<h3>ARTICLE I.<br />
<br />
</h3>

<p class="indent"><i>Of the great Merits of</i> Vitruvius, <i>and
the Excellencies of his Works</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft" alt="T" />here
are so many things in the Works of <i>Vitruvius</i> that do not
directly appertain to Architecture, that one would <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> think they were
less fitted to Instruct those that have a design to learn the
Precepts of this Art, than to perswade the World that the Author
was the most knowing Architect that ever was, and a Person of the
greatest Merit: He had the Honour to serve <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> and <i>Augustus</i>, the two Greatest and most
Magnificent Princes of the World, in an Age when all things were
come to the highest degree of Perfection.</p>

<p>For one may see in reading his Works, which are full of a
wonderful variety of Matters, which he treats of with a singular
Erudition, that this great Man had acquired that Profound Knowledge
which is necessary for his Profession by more excellent Methods,
and more capable of producing something excellent, than the bare
exercise and ordinary practice <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
6.<br />
Preface.</i></span> of a Mechanical Art could possibly do; being
compleat in all the Liberal Arts and Sciences, and his great Wit
being accustomed, even from his Cradle, to understand the most
difficult Matters: He had ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">3</a></span>quired a certain Facility which meer
Artizans have not, of penetrating the deepest Secrets, and all the
difficulties of so vast an Art, as that of Architecture.</p>

<p>Now as it&rsquo;s true that in the Practice and Exercise of
Arts, one does not <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />
 Pref.</i></span> always easily distinguish the Abilities of those
that work in them. The great Capacity of <i>Vitruvius</i> before
the publishing of his Book, which he Composed when he was in Years,
had not all the Esteem it deserved; which <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Preface.</i></span> he complains of in his Preface, and in the Age
he lived; though it was full of the most refined Wits, yet he had
the fortune of others, to find few to defend him from the Surprizes
and Attacks of false Reasoning, and from the injustice that
prejudice creates, to those who apply themselves more to cultivate
the Talents they possess, than to make parade of them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />

 Pref.</i><br /><br />
<i>Lib. 3.<br />
 Pref.</i><br /><br /><i>Lib. 3.<br />
 Pref.</i><i><br /><br />Lib. 6.<br />
 Pref.</i></span> <i>Vitruvius</i> was a Man, who, as to the
exteriour, made a small Figure, and who had not heaped up great
Riches by the practice of his Profession;<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> and having, as it were,
buried himself in study, and wholly given himself over to the
Contemplation of Sciences, understood little of the Arts of the
Court, or the Crafty Slights of pushing on his Fortune and making
himself considerable; for though he was bestowed upon, and
recommended to <i>Augustus</i>, by the Princess
<i>Octavia</i> his Sister, we cannot find that he was employed in
any Works of great Importance. The Noblest Edifice that we can
learn that <i>Augustus</i> caused to be built, was, the Theatre of
<i>Marcellus</i>; and this was done by another Architect: And the
only Fabrick we can find he was employed in was not at <i>Rome</i>, but at <i>Fano</i>, a
very little City; insomuch, that the greatest part of the
Architects of that Age, who had gained the general Vogue, being so
ignorant, that they did not know even (as himself is forced to
declare) the first Principles of their Art: The Quality of a mere
Architect was become so Contemptible, that if his Books had not
carried all the Marks of an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>traordinary Knowledge, and rare
abilities, and undeceived the World by taking away the prejudice
that his small employ created him, the Precepts he has left us
would have wanted that Authority that was necessary to support
them.</p>

<p>For Architecture being an Art that has scarce any other Rule to
walk by, in performing all those Excellencies her Works are capable
of, than what we call a Good Fancy, which truly distinguishes that
which is Beautiful and Good from that which is not so; it&rsquo;s
absolutely necessary that one be perswaded that the Fancy he
follows is better than any other; to the end, that this Perswasion
insinuating it self into them that study this Art, it may form in
them a Correct and Regular Idea, which without this Perswasion,
would be always floating and uncertain; so that to establish this
Good Fancy, it&rsquo;s necessary to have one to whom we give great
deference, and who has merited great Credit by the Learning that is
found in his Writings; and is believed to have<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> had sufficient
abilities of chusing well among all Antiquity, that which is most
solid and capable of founding the Precepts of Architecture.</p>

<p>The Veneration we have for the first Inventers of Arts, is not
only Natural, but it&rsquo;s founded upon Reason; which makes us
judge, that he that had the first Thought, and first invented any
Thing, must needs have had a fitter Genius, and a better Capacity
for it, than all those that afterwards laboured to bring it to its
utmost Perfection. The <i>Greeks</i>, who were the Inventers of
Architecture, as well as of other Sciences, having left many Works
behind them as well in Building as in Books, which were looked upon
in the time of <i>Vitruvius</i>, as the Models of what was perfect
and accomplished in this Art, <i>Vitruvius</i> chiefly followed and
imitated them; and in the Composition of his Book, gathered from
them all that was to be found Excellent and Rare in all their
Works; which makes us believe, that he has omitted nothing that was
necessary, to form the Ge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7">7</a></span>neral Idea of Good and Beautiful, since there
is not the least probability that any thing could escape so Rare a
Wit, Illuminated with so many different Lights.</p>

<p>But because at present the Reputation of <i>Vitruvius</i> is so
generally established, that all Ages have placed him in the first
Rank of great Wits, and that there is nothing necessary to
recommend the Precepts of Architecture, but to prove they were
drawn out of his Works: We having here designed to make only an
Abridgment of his Works, we thought it would be necessary to cut
off many things that this Famous Author has drawn out of an
infinity of Writers, whose Works are now lost, and only gives a
short Account of the Contents of every Book, in the beginning of
this Abridgment; handling only in this Book, those Things that
directly belong to Architecture; disposing the Matter in a
different Method from that of <i>Vitruvius</i>, who often leaves
off the Matter he is treating of, and takes it up again in another
place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
The Order we have proposed to our selves in this Abstract, is, That
after having given an Account in few words of what is contained in
the whole Book; we Explain more particularly what we judge may be
serviceable to those that study Architecture. This Treatise is
divided into Two Parts; The First contains the Maxims and Precepts
that may be accommodated to <i>Modern</i> Architecture; the Second
contains all that appertains to the <i>Ancient</i> and
<i>Antique</i> Architectures; which, though often affected, have
little that&rsquo;s now made use of, may yet nevertheless serve to
form the Judgment, and regulate the Fancy, and serve for Examples
of things that may be useful.</p>

<p>I make a Distinction between the <i>Ancient</i> Architecture,
and the <i>Antique</i> Architecture, and the <i>Modern</i>; for we
call that Architecture <i>Ancient</i> of which <i>Vitruvius</i> has
writ, and of which we may as yet see many Examples in the Fabricks
that remain in <i>Greece</i>. The Architecture which we call
<i>Antique</i>, is that which may be<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> found in the Famous Edifices,
which, since the Time of <i>Vitruvius</i>, were built at
<i>Rome</i>, <i>Constantinople</i>, and many other places. The
<i>Modern</i>, is that which being more accommodated to the present
use, or for other Reasons, has changed some of the Dispositions and
Proportions which were observed by the <i>Ancient</i> and
<i>Antique</i> Architects.</p>

<h3>ART. II.</h3>

<p class="indent"><i>The Method of the Works of</i> Vitruvius,
<i>with short Arguments of every Book.</i></p>

<p><img src="images/capital_a.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="A" />ll
his Works are divided into Three Parts: The First <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> Treats of Building; The Second is
Gnomonical, and treats at large of Astronomical and Geometrical
Affairs. The Third gives Rules and Examples for making Machines or
Engines serviceable, either in War or Building. The First Part is
treated of in the Eight first Books: The Second in the Ninth: The
Third in the Last.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id=
"Page_10">10</a></span> The First Part which relates to Building is
twofold, for they are either publick or private. He speaks of
private Buildings in the Sixth Book; and as to that which relates
to publick Buildings, it&rsquo;s likewise divided into Three Parts,
<i>viz.</i> That which has Relation to Security, which consists in
Fortifications, described in the Third Chapter of the First Book;
That which appertains to Religion, of which he treats in the Third
and Fourth Books, and that which relates to publick Conveniencies,
as <i>Town-Houses</i>, <i>Theatres</i>, <i>Baths</i>,
<i>Academies</i>, <i>Market-places</i>, <i>Gates</i>; of which he
treats in the Fifth Book.</p>

<p>The Gnomonical part is treated of in the Ninth Book.</p>

<p>The Third Part which treats of Machines, is treated of in the
Tenth and Last Book.</p>

<p>Besides these particular Matters of Architecture, there are
Three things that appertain to all sort of Edifices, which are,
Solidity, Convenience, and Beauty. He speaks of Solidity in<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> the
Eleventh Chapter of the Sixth Book; of Convenience, in the Seventh
Chapter of the same Book; and of Beauty through the whole Chapter
of the Seventh Book; which contains all the Ornaments that Painting
and Sculpture are capable of giving to all sorts of Fabricks; and
as to Proportion, which ought to be esteemed one of the principal
Foundations of Beauty, it&rsquo;s treated of throughout all his
Works.</p>

<p>But to make it better understood, in what Method every Book
explains those things, we must tell you, That in the First Book,
after having treated of those things that belong to Architecture in
General, by the Enumeration of the Parts that compose it, and of
those that are required in an Architect, the Author explains in
particular what choice ought to be made of the Seat where we ought
to Build, as to Health and Convenience; after he speaks of the
Foundations and of the Building of Fortifications, and the Form of
Towers and Walls of Cities, he dilates himself<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> upon the Air
and Healthiness of the Situation.</p>

<p>In the Second Book, he speaks of the Original of Architecture,
and what were the first Habitations of Mankind; after he treats of
the Materials, <i>viz.</i> of Brick, Sand, Lime, Stones, and
Timber: After which he treats of the different Methods of laying,
binding, and Masonry of Stones. He Philosophizes upon their
Principles, and upon the Nature of Lime, upon the choice of Sand,
and the time of cutting of Wood.</p>

<p>The Third Book treats of the Proportion of the Temples, and of
seven sorts of them which are those called <i>Antes</i>,
<i>Prostyle</i>, <i>Amphiprostyle</i>, <i>Periptere</i>,
<i>Pseudiptere</i>, <i>Diptere</i> and <i>Hyp&aelig;thre</i>. After
he speaks of the Different spaces that ought to be betwxit every
Pillar, to which he gives the Five Names following, (which in the
latter Part of this Book shall be more fully explained, as well as
divers Terms of Art) <i>viz.</i> <i>Pycnostyle</i>, <i>Systyle</i>,
<i>Diastyle</i>, <i>Ar&aelig;ostyle</i> and <i>Eustyle</i>. After
that, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id=
"Page_13">13</a></span> gives in particular the Proportions of the
<i>Ionick</i> Order, and demonstrates that it has a Proportion with
Humane Bodies.</p>

<p>The Fourth gives the Proportion of the <i>Corinthian</i> and
<i>Dorick</i> Orders for Temples, with the Proportions of all the
Parts that compose them.</p>

<p>The Fifth treats of Publick Fabricks, <i>viz.</i> of
<i>Market-places</i>, <i>Theatres</i>, <i>Palaces</i>,
<i>Baths</i>, <i>Schools</i> for Sciences, and <i>Academies</i> for
Exercises, and in Conclusion, of <i>Sea-Ports</i>; and after
occasionally discourses at large upon Musick, because, speaking of
Theatres, he gives an account how the Ancient Architects, were in
some places of the Theatre wont to place Vessels of Brass to serve
for several sorts of tunable Echo&rsquo;s, and augmenting the Voice
of the Comedians.</p>

<p>In the Sixth he teaches what were the Proportions and Forms of
private Houses among the Greeks and Romans, as well in the City as
Country; and describes all the parts of the House, <i>viz.</i> the
Courts, Porches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">14</a></span> Halls, Dining Rooms, Chambers, Cabinets and
Libraries.</p>

<p>In the Seventh he treats of the manner of making use of Mortar
for Plaster and Floors; how Lime and the Powder of Marble ought to
be prepared to make Stuck. He speaks likewise of the Ornaments that
are common to all sorts of Buildings, as Painting; and all sorts of
Colours, as well Natural as Artificial, that the Ancients made use
of.</p>

<p>In the Eighth he speaks of Waters, and Rivers, and Fountains;
<i>viz.</i> of their Springs, of their Nature, and Properties; how
they are to be sought; and of the Conduits that are to bring them
to Cities and Villages.</p>

<p>The Ninth is wholly Gnomonical, and teaches the manner of making
Sun-Dials, and gives an account of the Rules of Geometry, how to
measure solid Bodies. He discourses at large of the Course of the
Stars, and the particular Description of those that are called
Fixed Stars.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id=
"Page_15">15</a></span> The Last is taken up wholly in the
Description of making Machines to lift up great Weights, and others
for several uses; <i>viz.</i> for the Elevation of Water for
Corn-Mills, Water-Organs and Measuring the Way as well by Sea as by
Land; but it chiefly treats of Machines fit for the use of Building
and War.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Original of Architecture.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span> <img src="images/capital_i.png" class=
"floatLeft" alt="I" />T&rsquo;s related by Historians, That Men,
who in former times inhabited Woods and Caverns like wild Beasts,
first assembled themselves to make Houses and Cities, which<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> was
occasioned by a Forest that was set on fire, which drew all the
Inhabitants together by its novelty and surprizing effects; so that
many Men meeting together in the same place, they found out means,
by helping one another, to harbour themselves more conveniently,
than in Caves and under Trees; so that it is pretended, that
Architecture was the Beginning and Original of all other Arts. For
Men seeing that they had success in Building, which necessity made
them invent, they had the Thoughts and Courage of seeking out other
Arts, and applying themselves to them.</p>

<p>Now even as they took Trees, Rocks and other Things that Nature
her self furnished Beasts to harbour themselves under, which were
made use of as Models for the first Houses, which at first were
only made of green Turf and broken Branches of Trees, they made use
of them afterwards, in the same manner, to arrive at something more
perfect. For passing from the Imitation of the Natural to<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> <span
class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> that of Artificial, they invented all the
Ornaments of Edifices that were most curiously wrought, in giving
them the Form and Shape of those things that are simply necessary
to the most natural Buildings: And the Pieces of Timber of which
the Roofs and Floors of Houses are made, were the Original of
<i>Pillars</i>, <i>Architraves</i>, <i>Frises</i>,
<i>Triglyphs</i>, <i>Mutils</i>, <i>Brackets</i>, <i>Corniches</i>,
<i>Frontons</i> or <i>Piediments</i>, which are made of Stone or
Marble.</p>

<p>The Pillars which are to be smaller at top than at bottom, were
made in Imitation of the Boles or Trunks of Trees, and their use
was taken from the Carpenters' Posts that are made to support the
Building. The <i>Architraves</i> which are laid across many
<i>Pillars</i>, represent <i>Summers</i> that join many
<i>Posts</i> together. The <i>Frises</i> imitate the <i>Muring</i>
that is raised upon the <i>Summers</i> betwixt the ends of the
Beams that are laid directly upon the <i>Pillars</i>. The
<i>Triglyphs</i> represent the Ceiling or Joyner&rsquo;s work which
was made upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id=
"Page_20">20</a></span> the ends of the Beams to conserve them. The
<i>Corniches</i> are as it were the extream parts of the
<i>Joists</i>. The <i>Modillions</i> represent the ends of the
Sheers, and the <i>Dentels</i> represent the ends of the principal
<i>Rafter</i>. The <i>Frontons</i> are made in imitation of the
<i>Firms</i> or <i>Girders</i>, upon which is laid the Roof of the
House.</p>

<p>There is likewise another Original of Architecture, which is
taken from the Inventers of the several Orders, and those that
added the Ornaments to embellish them. For it&rsquo;s the common
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> Opinion, that the first Fabrick that was
made, according to any of the Orders, was the Temple that King
<i>Dorus</i> built in Honour of <i>Juno</i> in the City
<i>Argos</i>. And it obtained the name of the <i>Dorick</i> Order,
when <i>Ion</i> the Conducter of a Colony, which he established in
<i>Asia</i>, made many Temples be built according to the Model of
the Temple built by <i>Dorus</i> in <i>Greece</i>.</p>

<p>But the <i>Ionians</i> having changed some of the Proportions
and Ornaments of the <i>Dorick</i> Order, were the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> Authors of
another Order, which was called the <i>Ionick</i>, according to
which, they built a Temple in Honour of <i>Diana</i>. The reason of
this change was, that this Temple being dedicated to a Divinity,
which they represented under the Shape of a Young Lady, they
thought it was proper to make their Pillars more tapering, the
better to represent the airy Stature of this Goddess, and for this
reason they adorned it more delicately, adding Bases which
represent the Buskin'd Ornaments of the Legs and Feet, according to
the Mode of that time; and Made the <i>Channellings</i> deeper to
represent the Foldings and Plaits of a fine light Garment. They put
likewise <i>Volutes</i> or <i>Scrowls</i> upon the <i>Capital</i>,
pretending that they imitated the Head-Dress of a Young Lady, whose
Hair Beautifully descending from the top of her Head, was folded up
under each Ear.</p>

<p>Afterwards <i>Calimachus</i> an <i>Athenian</i>, embellished the
Capitals of the Pillars, adding to them more Beautiful<span class=

<i>Volutes</i> or <i>Scrowls</i>, and more in number, enriching
them with the Leaves of <i>Brank Ursine</i> and Roses. It&rsquo;s
said, That this Capital, which, according to <i>Vitruvius</i>,
makes all the Distinction betwixt the <i>Corinthian</i> and
<i>Ionick</i> Order, was invented by this ingenious Artisan upon
this occasion. Having seen the Leaves of the above-mentioned Plant
grow round about a Basket which was set upon the Tomb of a Young
<i>Corinthian</i> Lady, and which, as it happened, was set upon the
middle of the Plant. He represented the Basket by the
<i>Tambour</i> or <i>Vase</i> of the Capital, to which he made an
<i>Abacus</i> to imitate the Tile with which the Basket was
covered, and that he represented the Stalks of the Herb by the
<i>Volutes</i> or <i>Scrowls</i>, which were ever after placed upon
the <i>Corinthian</i> Capital. See Table the <a href=
"#p_9">IXth.</a></p>

<p>This great Artist likewise invented other Ornaments, as those we
call <i>Eggs</i>, because of the <i>Ovals</i> in the <i>Relief</i>
which are in the Mouldings of the <i>Corniches</i> and are like
<i>Eggs</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id=
"Page_23">23</a></span> The Ancients called this Ornament
<i>Echinus</i>, which signifies the sharp prickly shell of
Chestnuts, because they found these Ovals represented a Chestnut
half open, as it is when it&rsquo;s ripe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />

Famous Author, who found out the proportion of all the Parts of a
Fabrick, which was <i>Hermogenes</i>; to whom he attributes the
Invention of the <i>Eustyle</i>, <i>Pseudodiptere</i>, and of all
that is beautiful and excellent in Architecture.</p>

<div class="center"><i>What Architecture is.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_a.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
"I" />Rchitecture is a Science which ought to be accompanied with
the Knowledge of a great many other Arts and Sciences, by which
means <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
 Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span> it forms a correct Judgment of all the
Works of other Arts that appertain to it. This Science is
acquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24">24</a></span> by <i>Theory</i> and <i>Practice</i>. The
<i>Theory</i> of <i>Architecture</i> is that Knowledge of this Art
which is acquired by study, travelling and discourse. The Practick
is that knowledge that is acquired by the Actual Building of great
Fabricks. These Two Parts are so necessary, that never any came to
any great Perfection without them both. The one being lame and
imperfect without the other, so they must walk hand in hand.</p>

<p>Besides, the Knowledge of things that particularly belong to
Architecture, there are infinite other things that are necessary to
be known by an Architect.</p>

<p>For, First, it&rsquo;s necessary that he be able to couch in
writing his intended Building, and to design the Plan, and make an
excellent Model of it.</p>

<p>Geometry likewise is very necessary for him in many
occasions.</p>

<p>He must also know Arithmetick to make a true Calculation.</p>

<p>He must be knowing in History, and be able to give a reason for
the greatest part of the Ornaments of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> Architecture which are founded
upon History. For Example, if instead of Pillars he support the
Floors of the House with the figures of Women, which are called
<i>Cariatides</i>, he ought to know that the <i>Greeks</i> invented
these Figures to let Posterity know the Victories they obtained
over the <i>Cariens</i>, whose Wives they made Captives, and put
their Images in their Buildings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s necessary likewise, that he be instructed in the
Precepts of Moral Philosophy; for he ought to have a great Soul,
and be bold without Arrogance, just, faithful, and totally exempt
from Avarice.</p>

<p>The Architect also ought to have <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;11.</i></span> a great Docility which may hinder him
from neglecting the advice that is given him, not only by the
meanest Artist, but also by those that understand nothing of
Architecture; for not only Architects, but all the World must judge
of his Works.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> Natural Philosophy is likewise necessary
for him for to discover what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26"
id="Page_26">26</a></span> are the Causes of many things which he
must put a remedy to.</p>

<p>He ought also to know something of <i>Physick</i>, to know the
qualities of the Air, which makes Places Healthful and Habitable,
or the quite contrary.</p>

<p>He should not be ignorant of the Laws and the Customs of Places
for the Building of Partition Walls, for prospect and for the
conveying of Waters and Sewers.</p>

<p>He ought to know <i>Astronomy</i>, that he may be able to make
all sorts of Dials.</p>

<p>It was necessary among the Ancients, that an Architect should
have skill in <i>Musick</i> to make and order <i>Catapults</i> and
other Machines of War, which were strung with strings made of Guts,
whose sound they were to observe, that they might judge of the
strength and stiffness of the Beams which were bended with those
Strings. <i>Musick</i> was also necessary in those days for the
placing musically Vessels of Brass in the Theatres, as we have said
before.</p>

<h3>ART. III.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>What are the Parts of
Architecture.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft" alt="T" />Here
are Three Things which ought to meet in every Fabrick, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Solidity</i>, <i>Convenience</i> and <i>Beauty</i>, which
Architecture gives them; by the due ordering and disposition of all
the Parts that compose the Edifice, and which she rules by a just
Proportion, having regard to a true <i>Decorum</i>, and well
regulated <i>Oeconomy</i>; from whence it follows, that
Architecture has Eight Parts, <i>viz.</i> <i>Solidity</i>,
<i>Convenience</i>, <i>Beauty</i>, <i>Order</i>,
<i>Disposition</i>, <i>Decorum</i>, <i>Oeconomy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Solidity</i> depends upon the goodness of the Foundation,
choice of Materials, and the right use of them; which ought to be
with a due order, disposition and convenient Proportion of all
Parts together, and of one in respect of another.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id=
"Page_28">28</a></span> <i>Convenience</i> likewise consists in the
ordering and disposition, which is so good that nothing hinders the
use of any part of the Edifice.</p>

<p><i>Beauty</i> consists in the excellent and agreeable form, and
the just proportion of all its parts.</p>

<p><i>Order</i> is that which makes, that all the parts of an
Edifice have a convenient bigness, whether we consider them apart
or with Relation to the whole.</p>

<p><i>Disposition</i> is the orderly Ranging and agreeable Union of
all the parts that compose the Work; so that as Order respects the
Greatness, Disposition respects Form and Situation, which are Two
Things compriz'd under the word <i>Quality</i>, which
<i>Vitruvius</i> attributes to Disposition, and opposes to
Quantity, which appertains to Order. There are three ways by which
the Architect may take a view beforehand of the Fabrick he is to
build, <i>viz.</i> First, <i>Ichnography</i>, which is the
<i>Geometrical</i> Plan; <i>Orthography</i>, which is the
<i>Geometrical Elevation</i>, and <i>Scenography</i>, which is
<i>Perspective Elevation</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29">29</a></span> <i>Proportion</i>, which is also call'd
<i>Eurythmy</i>, is that which makes the Union of all parts of the
Work, and which renders the Prospect agreeable, when the Height
answers the Breadth, and the Breadth the Length; every one having
its just measure. It is defin'd, the Relation that all the Work has
with its Parts, and which every one of them has separately to the
Idea of the whole, according to the measure of any Part. For as in
Humane Bodies there is a Relation between the Foot, Hand, Finger
and other Parts; so amongst Works that are Perfect, from any
particular Part, we may make a certain Judgment of the Greatness of
the whole Work: For Example, the Diameter of a Pillar, or the
Length of a <i>Triglyph</i>, creates in us a right Judgment of the
Greatness of the whole Temple.</p>

<p>And here we must remark, that to express the Relation that many
things have one to another, as to their Greatness or different
Number of Parts, <i>Vitruvius</i> indifferently makes<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> use of three
words, which are <i>Proportion</i>, <i>Eurythmy</i> and
<i>Symmetry</i>. But we have thought it proper only to make use of
the word Proportion, because <i>Eurythmy</i> is a Greek word, which
signifies nothing else but Proportion; and Symmetry, although a
word commonly used, does not signifie in the Vulgar Languages what
<i>Vitruvius</i> understands by Proportion; for he understands by
Proportion, a Relation according to Reason; and Symmetry, in the
vulgar Languages, signifies only, a Relation of Parity and
Equality. For the word <i>Simmetria</i> signifies in Latin and
Greek <i>Relation</i> only. As for Example, as the Relation that
Windows of Eight Foot high, have with other Windows of Six Foot,
when the one are Four Foot broad, and the other Three: and
Symmetry, in the Vulgar Languages, signifies the Relation, for
Example, That Windows have one to another, when they are all of an
equal height and equal breadth; and that their Number and Distances
are equal to the Right and the Left;<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> so that if the distances be
unequal of one side, the like inequality is to be found in the
other.</p>

<p>Decorum or Decency, is that which makes the Aspect of the
Fabrick so correct, that there is nothing that is not approv'd of,
and founded upon some Authority. It teaches us to have regard to
three things, which are, <i>Design</i>, <i>Custom</i> and
<i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p>The Regard to Design makes us chuse for Example, other
Dispositions and Propertions for a Palace than for a Church.</p>

<p>The Respect we have to Custom, is the Reason, for Example, That
the Porches and Entries of Houses are adorned, when the Inner Parts
are Rich and Magnificent.</p>

<p>The Regard we have to the Nature of Places, makes us chuse
different Prospects for different Parts of the Fabrick, to make
them the wholsomer and the more convenient: For Example, the
Bed-Chambers and the Libraries are exposed to the Morning Sun; the
Winter Apartments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id=
"Page_32">32</a></span> to the West; the Closets or Pictures and
other Curiosities, which should always have equal Light, to the
North.</p>

<p>Oeconomy teaches the Architect to have regard to the Expences
that are to be made, and to the Quality of the Materials, near the
Places where he Builds, and to take his Measures rightly for the
Order and Disposition; <i>viz.</i> to give the Fabrick a convenient
Form and Magnitude.</p>

<p>These Eight Parts, as we have said, have a Relation to the Three
first, <i>viz.</i> <i>Solidity</i>, <i>Convenience</i>,
<i>Beauty</i>, which suppose, <i>Order, Disposition</i>,
<i>Proportion</i>, <i>Decorum</i> and <i>Oeconomy</i>. This is the
reason that we divide this first Part only into Three Chapters; the
first is of the Solidity; the second of the Convenience; the third
of the Beauty of the Fabrick.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Solidity of Buildings.</i></div>

<h3>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Choice of Materials.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
Materials of which <i>Vitruvius</i> speaks are, Stone, Brick, Wood,
Lime, and Sand.</p>

<p>All the Stones are not of one sort, for some are soft, some
harder, and some extreamly hard.</p>

<p>Those that are not hard are easily cut, and are good for the
Inner Parts of the Buildings, where they are cover'd from Rain and
Frost which brings them to Powder, and if they be made use of in
Buildings near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">34</a></span> Sea, the Salt Particles of the Air and Heat
destroys them.</p>

<p>Those that are indifferently hard, are fit to bear Weight; but
there are some sorts of them, that easily crack with the heat of
the Fire.</p>

<p>There is likewise another sort of Stone, which is a kind of
Free-Stone; some are Red, some Black, and some White, which are as
easily cut with a Saw as Wood.</p>

<p>The best Bricks are those which are only dry'd and not baked in
the Fire; but there are many Years required to dry them well: and
for this Reason, at <i>Utica</i>, a City of <i>Africa</i>, they
made a Law, That none should make use of Bricks which had not been
made five Years: For these sort of Bricks, so dry'd, had their
Pores so close in their Superficies, that they would swim upon
Water like a Pumice-Stone; and they had a particular Lightness,
which made them very fit for all sorts of Buildings.</p>

<p>The Earth of which these Bricks were usually made was very Fat,
and a sort of White Chalky Clay without<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span> Gravel or Sand, which
made them Lighter and more Durable; they mixed Straw with them to
make them better bound and firmer.</p>

<p>The Woods which were made use of in all Buildings, are Oak,
Poplar, Beech, Elm, Cypress, Firr; but some of them are not so
proper for Building as others.</p>

<p>The Firr, because it has great plenty of Air, and Fire, and but
little Earth and Water, is light, and does not easily bend; but is
very subject to Worms and Fire.</p>

<p>The Oak which is more Earthy lasts for ever under Ground; but
above Ground is apt to cleave.</p>

<p>The Beech which has little of Earthiness, Humidity and Fire, but
great plenty of Air, is not very solid and easily breaks.</p>

<p>The Poplar and the Linden Trees are only good for light Work,
they are easily cut and so finest for Carving.</p>

<p>The Alder is good to make Piles of in Marshy Places.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36">36</a></span> The Elm and the Ash have this property,
that they do not easily cleave, and that they are pliable.</p>

<p>The Yoke-Elm is likewise pliable, and yet very strong; this is
the Reason that they made Yokes for their Oxen of them in Old
Time.</p>

<p>The Pine and the Cypress have this defect, that they easily bend
under any Weight, because of their great Humidity; but they have
this Advantage, that their Humidity does not engender Worms,
because of their Bitterness which kills them.</p>

<p>The Juniper and the Cedar have the same Vertue of hindering
Corruption: the Juniper by its Gum, which is call'd
<i>Sandarax</i>, and the Cedar by its Oil call'd
<i>Cedrium</i>.</p>

<p>The Larch-Tree has likewise the same Vertue, but its particular
property is, that it will not burn. There is a remarkable Story of
this Wood, which is, That when <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> besieg'd a
Castle at the Foot of the <i>Alpes</i>, there was a Tower built of
this Wood, which prov'd the Principal Defence of the Place. He<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
thought to take it easily by making a great Fire at the Foot of the
Tower, but for all this great Fire, the Tower did not suffer the
least Damage.</p>

<p>The Olive-Tree is likewise very serviceable, if it be put in the
Foundations, and Walls of Cities; for after it has been singed a
little, and interlaced among the Stones, it lasts for ever, and is
out of all danger of Corruption.</p>

<p>Lime is made of White Stones or Flinty Pebbles, the harder the
Stones are which 'tis made of, the better it is for Building. That
which is made of soft Spongy Stones, is proper for Plastring.</p>

<p>There are five sorts of Sand; <i>viz.</i> Sand that is dug out
of the Ground, River Sand, Gravel, Sea-Sand, and Pozzolana, which
is a Sand peculiar to some Parts of <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<p>The best Sand is that which being rubb'd between the Hands makes
a little Noise, which that Sand does not, which is Earthy, because
it is not rough. Another Mark of good Sand is, that when 'tis put
upon any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id=
"Page_38">38</a></span> Thing that is White and shak'd off, it
leaves no Mark behind.</p>

<p>The Sand which is dug out of the Earth has all these Qualities,
and is esteem'd the best. <i>Vitruvius</i> makes four sorts of it;
<i>viz.</i> White, Black, Red, and Bright like a Carbuncle.</p>

<p>If it happen that there be no good Place to dig Sand in, we may
make use of Sea-Sand, or River-Sand, which is likewise better for
Plastering than the Sand which is digged, which is excellent for
Building, because it drys quickly. Gravel likewise is very good,
provided the grosser Parts be taken away. Sea-Sand is worst of all,
because 'tis long adrying; and for this Reason, where 'tis made use
of in Building, they are forc'd to desist sometimes till it
dry.</p>

<p>The Sand which is found near <i>Naples</i> call'd
<i>Pozzolana</i> is so proper to make good Mortar, if it be mixed
with Lime, that not only in the ordinary Fabricks, but even in the
very bottom of the Sea it grows into a wonderful hard Body. In Old
Times they made use of it for Moles or Ports<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> of the Sea,
for after having made with Piles and Boards a Partition, they
fill'd up the whole Compass of the Partition with this Mortar,
which dry'd of it self in the middle of the Water and became a
solid Body.</p>

<hr />
<h3>ART. II.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Use of the Materials.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
first thing we should have a Care of before we begin to build, is,
to have the Stones dug out of the Quarry before they be used, and
to expose them in some open Place, to the end that those which are
endamaged by the Air, during this Time, may be put in the
Foundation, and those that prove Durable and Good may be kept for
the Walls above Ground.</p>

<p>We must likewise have a great care of the Wood which we make use
of; That it be cut in a seasonable Time, which is in Autumn
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40">40</a></span> Winter; for then it is not full of that
superfluous Humidity which weakened it in dilating its Fibers, but
it is firm and well closed by the Cold. This is so true, that the
Wood of Trees which grow and become very great in a little Time, by
reason of their great Humidity, is tender and apt to break, and
very unfit for Building Which Experience shows us particularly in
those Firrs call'd <i>Supernates</i>, which grow in <i>Italy</i>,
on that side the <i>Apennine</i>, towards the <i>Adriatick</i>-Sea,
for they are great and beautiful, but their Wood is not good for
Building; whereas those on the other side of the Mountain, which
are exposed to Heat and Dryness, call'd <i>Infernates</i>, are very
good for Building.</p>

<p>This superfluous Humidity endamages Trees so much, that we are
sometimes constrain'd to make a hole at the foot of the Tree and
let it run out, which is the occasion of the Practice which is
observ'd in cutting of Wood for Building, to Tap that Tree at the
Foot, cutting not only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41">41</a></span> Bark, but even some part of the Wood it
self, and so leave it for some time before it be Fell'd.</p>

<p>It is likewise easie to judge of what great Importance the
draining of this superfluous Humidity is for strengthning <span
class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
 Chap.&nbsp;5.</i></span> the Timber, and hindring Corruption, from
this, That those Piles which are interlaced among the Stones in the
Walls and Fortifications of Towns endure for ever without
Corrupting, when they have been burnt a little on the outside.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
 Chap.&nbsp;11.</i><br /><br /><i>Lib. 2.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;8.</i></span> Bricks ought not to be made use of but
in very thick Walls; for this reason they did not build with Brick
in <i>Rome</i>, for to save Ground; they were not permitted to make
the Walls of their Houses above a Foot and a Half thick, which Makes about 16
Inches and a half of our Foot.</p>

<p>They likewise never made the top of their Walls with Brick; for
the Brick of the Ancients not being baked, this part of the Wall
would have been easily endamaged; for this reason they built it
with Tiles, a foot and a half high, comprizing the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span> Cornish or
Entablature which was made likewise of Tiles to cast off the Water
and defend the rest of the Wall. They likewise chose for these
Cornishes the best Tiles, <i>viz.</i> those that had been long on
the top of the Houses, and given sufficient Proof that they were
well baked and made of good Matter.</p>

<p>The Walling with Brick was so much esteem'd among the Ancients,
that all their Fabricks, as well publick as private, and their most
beautiful Palaces were built with them. But that which principally
made this sort of Building be esteem'd, was its great Duration; for
when expert Architects were called to make an Estimate of
Buildings, they always deducted an 80th. part of what they judged
the Building cost for every Year that the Wall had been standing,
for they supposed that the Walls could not ordinarily endure more
than Fourscore Years; but when they valued Buildings of Brick, they
always valued them at what they cost at first, supposing them to be
of an Eternal Duration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
"Page_43">43</a></span> To make the right use of Lime and Sand, and
to make good Mortar of them, it is necessary that the Lime be first
well Quench'd, and that it be kept a long time, to the end that if
there be any Piece of it that is not well burnt in the Kiln, it
may, being extinguished at leasure, soften as well as the rest.
This is of Great Importance particularly in Plastering and Works of
<i>Stuck</i>, which is a Composition of Marble finely beaten with
Lime. For if any little Pieces remain that are not well baked, when
they come to be made use of, they crack and break the Work.</p>

<p>The way to know whether the Lime be well Quench'd, is thus: You
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 7.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> may thrust a Chip of Wood into it or a
Knife, and if the Chip of Wood meet with any Stones, or that the
Knife comes out clean without any sticking to it, it signifies the
Lime was not will burnt; for when 'tis well Quench'd, it is Fat and
will stick to the Knife; but the quite contrary happens to Mortar,
for it is neither well prepar'd, nor well mix'd, if it stick to the
Trowel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id=
"Page_44">44</a></span> For to make the right use of <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;4.</i></span> Sand, you must first consider what it is
to be employ'd in; for if it be Mortar for Plastring, you must not
make use of Sand that was lately dug out, for it drys the Mortar
too fast, which cracks the Plastring; but quite contrary if it be
to be employ'd in Masonry, it must not have been a long time
expos'd to the Air, for the Sun and the Moon do so alter it, that
the Rain dissolves it, and turns it almost all into Earth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;5.</i></span> The Proportion that Sand and Lime ought to
have to make good Mortar, should be three parts of Sand that is
dug, or two parts of River-Sand or Sea-Sand against one of Lime,
and 'twill be yet much better, if you add to the Sand of the Sea
and the River a third part of Tiles well beaten.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 7.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> One of the Principal Things that is to be
observ'd in making Mortar, is, to mix it well. The Grecian Workmen
were so careful of this, that they Tewed it a great while, putting
Ten Men to every Vessel wherein they<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> wrought it, which gave so
great a hardness to the Mortar, that when any big pieces of Plaster
fell off the Old Walls, they made Tables of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />

"floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE Foundation is the most important part of
the Fabrick; for the Faults committed in it cannot be so easily
remedied as in other parts.</p>

<p>To lay the Foundation well, you <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;5.</i></span> must dig till you come to solid Ground,
and even into the solid as much as is necessary to support the
Weight of the Walls; it must be larger below than above the
Superficies of the Earth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> When you have found firm Earth to make it
more solid, you must beat it with a Rammer; but if you cannot
arrive at solid Earth, but find it still soft and spungy, you must
dig as far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
"Page_46">46</a></span> as you can, and drive in Piles of Alder,
Olive, or Oak, a little singed, near together, and fill up the void
Places between the Piles with Coal.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;5.</i></span> In short, you must make all Masonry with
the most solid Stone that can be found for this use.</p>

<p>To make the Binding of the Stones the stronger in the Foundation
of great Fabricks, you must put Piles of Olive a little singed and
placed very thick from one Parement or Course to another, which
serves, as it were, for Keys and Braces; for this Wood so prepar'd,
is not subject to Worms, and will endure for ever, either in the
Earth or in the Water, without the least Damage.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;11.</i></span> When you would make Cellars, the
Foundations must be much larger; for the Wall that is to support
the Earth requires a greater thickness to resist the strong Efforts
that the Earth makes against it in Winter, at which time it swells
and becomes more heavy by reason of the Water it has drunk up.</p>

<p>The <i>Net-Masonry</i> is that which is made of Stones perfectly
squar'd in their Courses, and are laid so, that the Joints go
obliquely, and the Diagonals are the one Perpendicular, and the
other Level. This is the most pleasing Masonry to the Sight,
but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id=
"Page_48">48</a></span> it is apt to crack. See the Figure A. <a
href="#p_1">Table I.</a></p>

<p>The Masonry call'd the <i>Bound-Masonry</i>, is that, as
<i>Vitruvius</i> explains it, in which the Stones are plac'd one
upon another like Tiles; that is to say, where the Joints of the
Beds are Level, and the Mounters are Perpendicular; so that the
Joint that mounts and separates two Stones falls directly upon the
middle of the Stone which is below.</p>

<p>Some Authors call this sort of Masonry <i>Incertain</i>, but
they are mistaken; for they read <i>Incerta</i> instead of
<i>Inserta</i>; it is not so Beautiful as the Net-work, but it is
more solid and durable. See the Figure BB. <a href="#p_1">Table
I.</a></p>

<p>The Masonry which <i>Vitruvius</i> says is particular to the
<i>Greeks</i>, is that, where after we have laid two Stones, each
of which make a Parement or <i>Course</i>, another is laid at the
end, which makes two Parements or <i>Courses</i>, and all the
Building through observe this Order. This may be call'd
<i>Double-Binding</i>; for the Binding is not only of Stones of the
same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49">49</a></span> <i>Course</i> one with another, but
likewise of one <i>Course</i> with another <i>Course</i>. See
Figure CC. <a href="#p_1">Table I.</a></p>

<p>The manner of Walling by unequal Courses call'd <i>Isodomum</i>
by the Ancients, differs in nothing from the Masonry call'd
<i>Bound-Masonry</i>, but only in this, that the Stones are not
hewed. See Figure D. <a href="#p_1">Table I.</a></p>

<p>The other manner by unequal Courses call'd <i>Pseudisodomum</i>
is also made of unhewed Stone, and laid in <i>Bound-Work</i>, but
they are not of the same thickness, and there is no equality
observ'd, but only in the several Courses, the Courses themselves
being unequal one to another. See Figure A. <a href="#p_1">Table
I.</a></p>

<p>The Masonry which is fill'd up in the middle, call'd by the
Ancients <i>Emplecton</i>, is likewise made of unhewed Stone and by
Courses, but the Stones are only set in order as to the
<i>Parements</i> or <i>Courses</i>, but the middle is fill'd up
with Stones thrown in carelesly among the Mortar. See Fig. FF, GG,
H. <a href="#p_1">Table I.</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id=
"Page_50">50</a></span> Among all these sorts of Masonry, that will
always be best which is made of Stones of an indifferent size,
rather lesser than greater; to the end that the Mortar penetrating
them in more parts may bind them faster, and the strength of the
Mortar does not so soon decay. For we see that the Mortar which is
laid in the Joints or Seams of the greater Stones with time decays
and turns to Dust, which never happens to the most Ancient Fabricks
which have been built of little Stones. From thence we may
conclude, that it is ill Husbandry to be sparing of Mortar.</p>

<p>For this reason <i>Vitruvius</i> proposes another sort of
Masonry, which may be call'd the <i>Compound Masonry</i>, for it is
all the former together, of Stones hewed and unhewed, and fastned
together with Cramp-Irons. The Structure is as follows: The
<i>Courses</i> being made of hew'd Stone, the middle place which
was left void is fill'd up with Mortar and Pebbles thrown in
together; after this they bind the Stones of one <i>Parement</i>
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id=
"Page_51">51</a></span> <i>Course</i> to those of another with
Cramp-Irons fasten'd with melted Lead. This is done to the end,
that the abundance of Mortar which is in the middle may furnish and
communicate a sufficient Humidity to the Joints of the great Stones
which make the <i>Parements</i>. See the Figure K. <a href=
"#p_1">Table I.</a></p>

<p>There are many Precautions to be given to make the Masonry more
firm and durable, and these Precautions are common to all the
different sorts of Masonry.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;5.</i></span> When you would have the Walls very thick,
for great and heavy Buildings, you must strengthen the inner part
of the Wall with long Piles of singed Olive, which serves for Keys
and Braces, for this Wood being so prepar'd never corrupts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;11.</i><br/><br/><i>Vide Index.</i></span> It is likewise of great Importance for
the strength of Walls, that all be directly Perpendicular, and that
the <i>Chains</i>, the <i>Pillars</i> and <i>Pieds-droits</i> or
<i>Piers</i> be so situated, that <i>solid</i> always answer'd to the <i>solid</i>;
for if there be any part of the Wall or any<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> Pillar that carrys false,
it is impossible the Work should continue long.</p>

<p>There are also two ways of strengthning the Walls, which are
either to ease them of their own weight, or of that of the Earth
which they are to support.</p>

<p>The first way of easing is in those Places where there are void
spaces, as above Doors or Windows. These easements may be made two
different ways; the first is to put over the Lintel which supports
the Wall, which is over the void space of the Gates and Windows,
two Beams, which lying or resting below directly upon
<i>Pieds-droits</i> or <i>Piers</i> meet together above.</p>

<p>The other way is, to make directly over the void spaces Vaulted
Arches with Stones cut corner-ways and tending to one Center. For
the Walls be so strengthned by the means of these easements, that
part of the Wall which is below will not sink at all being easied
of the load of the part that is above, and if some de<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>fect should
happen by tract of time, it may be mended without propping that
which is above.</p>

<p>The second way of easing, is, for Walls that are made to support
the Earth; for, besides the extraordinary thickness which they
ought to have, they should have likewise Buttresses on that side
next the Earth, so far distant one from another as is the breadth
of the Wall; they ought likewise to have an <i>Emparement</i> or
large Foundation which must be equal to the height of the Wall, so
that they go diminishing by degrees from the bottom to the top,
where they come to equal the height of the Wall.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;5.</i></span> The effect of these <i>Buttresses</i> is
not only to support the Earth by their Resistance, but likewise to
lessen its Efforts when it swells, in dividing it into many
parts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;11.</i></span> And it be judg'd that these
<i>Buttresses</i> be not sufficient, the Wall also which supports
the Earth must be strengthned with other <i>Buttresses</i>
within.</p>

<h3>ART. V.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of Flooring and Ceiling.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=
"T" />Here are four sorts of Flooring, some are upon the
<i>Superficies</i> of the Ground, others between two Stories,
others make the Roof of the House in Plat-form, and the last is
<i>Plat-Fond</i>.</p>

<p>To make those Floors that are upon the Ground, you must first
make the Earth smooth and plain, if it be firm and solid, if not,
it must be beaten with a Rammer with which they ram down their
Piles; and after having cover'd the Earth with the first <i>Lay</i>
or <i>Bed</i>, call'd <i>Statumen</i> by the Ancients, which was of
Flinty Stones about the bigness of ones Fist, among which was mixed
Mortar made of Lime and Sand. Then they laid the second <i>Bed</i>,
which they call'd <i>Rudus</i>, which was made of lesser Stones, of
which there were three Parts for one<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> of Stone if they were new, for
if they were taken out of old Buildings, five parts of Stones or
Pibbles would be required for two of Lime.</p>

<p>The <i>Greeks</i> had a way of making their <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 7.<br />
Cap. 4.</i></span> Floors in those low places where cold and
humidity ordinarily reign, which freed them from these
Inconveniences. They digged the Earth two Foot deep, and after
having beaten it well, they laid a Bed of Mortar or Cement a little
sloping from either side to the Channel, which convey'd the Water
under Ground; they laid a Bed of Coal upon the first Mortar, and
having beaten them well, they cover'd them with another Cement or
Mortar made of Lime, Sand and Ashes, which they made smooth when it
was dry with a Polishing-Stone. These Floors presently drank up the
Water that fell upon them, that one might walk barefoot without
being incommoded by the Cold.</p>

<p>For the Floors which are between two Stories, there must be a
particular care taken, that if there be any Partition below it,
that it may not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id=
"Page_56">56</a></span> touch the Flooring for fear lest if the
Flooring came to sink a little, it might be broke upon the
Partition which remains firm.</p>

<p>To make these Floorings, the Boards must be nailed at each end
upon every Joist, to the end they may not warp; these Boards or
Planks being cover'd with Straw, to hinder the Lime from wasting
the Timber, the first Bed must be laid, made of a mixture of Mortar
and little Stones a hand breadth, which must be beaten a long time
with Iron-Levers, and so it must make a solid Crust which must be
nine Inches thick; upon it shall be laid the <i>Noyau</i> or
<i>Ame</i>, which must be at least six inches thick: It must be
made of Cement, with which must be mix'd one part Lime for two
parts <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 7.<br />
Cap. 4.</i></span> of Cement. Upon the <i>Ame</i> or <i>Noyau</i>
is placed the <i>Parement</i> made with the Rule, afterwards it
must be scrap'd and all the Eminences and Inequality taken away:
After that must be laid a Composition of Lime, Sand and beaten
Marble, to fill equally all the Seams or Joints.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id=
"Page_57">57</a></span> If a Flooring be to be made in the open
Air, as upon <i>Terrasses</i>, that may endure Rain or Frost
without any Damage; you must nail upon the Joists two Ranks of
Boards across, one above the other; and having laid the first Bed,
as is said before, it must be Paved with great Square Bricks two
Foot Square, which must be hollow'd in the Ends in the Form of a
half-Channel, the breadth of an Inch, which must be fill'd with
Lime mixed with Oil. These Square Bricks must be higher in the
middle, sloping two Inches for every six Foot; that is to say, a
Forty-eighth Part. Upon these Square Bricks must be laid the
<i>Ame</i>; upon which, after it has been well beaten, as well as
the rest, must be put great Square Stones; and to hinder the
Moisture from hurting the Boards, it is good to pour as much of the
Lees of Oil as they will soak up.</p>

<p>The under part of the Flooring, and the <i>Plat-Fonds</i>, must
be made also with great Care. To make the <i>Plat-Fonds</i> or
<i>Flat-roofs</i>, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">58</a></span> Form of a Vault, you must nail to the
Joists of the Boards, or to the <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;10.</i></span> Rafters of the Roof, from two Foot to two
Foot pieces of crooked Timber, and Choice must be made of Timber
that is not apt to rot; such as, <i>viz.</i> <i>Cypress</i>,
<i>Box</i>, <i>Juniper</i>, and <i>Olive</i>; no <i>Oke</i> must be
made use of, because it will warp and crack the Work. The Joists
being fastened to the <i>Suntmers</i>, you must fix to them
<i>Spanish-Broom</i> with <i>Greek-Reeds</i> well beaten. These
Reeds are in stead of Laths, which at present are made use of to
make the Eaves of Houses; over these Reeds must be laid a Plaster
of Mortar, made of Sand, to hinder the Drops of Water which may
fall from above from endamaging these <i>Plat-Fonds</i>. After
which, the under part must be Plaster'd pretty thick, making all
Places equal with Mortar made of Lime and Sand, that it may be
afterwards Polished with Mortar made with Lime and Marble.</p>

<p>The Ancients sometimes made double <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;10.</i></span> Vaults, when they were afraid that the
Humidity which is engender'd, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span> might rot the Wood which is
upon by the Vapours which mount up the Vaults. This Method they
principally made use of in their Baths.</p>

<p>The <i>Corniches</i> which are made use of under the
<i>Plat-Fonds</i>, ought to be little, lest their great Jetting
out, or Projecture should make them heavy, and apt to fall. For
this Reason they ought to be made of pure Stuck of Marble, without
any Plaster, that all the Work drying at the same time, may be less
apt to break.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of Plastering</i>.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />O
make Plaster that it may continue a long time, and not crack; you
must take Care to lay it on Walls that are very Dry; for if the
Walls be Moist, the Plastering being expos'd to the Air, and drying
faster than the Walls, will crack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
"Page_60">60</a></span> To do this Methodically, it must be laid,
Bed after Bed, or Lay after Lay, having a great Care not to lay one
Bed till the other be almost dry. The Ancients put six Lays, three
of Mortar made of Lime and Sand, and three of Stuck. The first Lays
or Beds were always thicker than the last, and they were very
careful to make use of no Mortar made either of Sand or Stuck in
their Plastring, that had not been a long time beaten and mix'd
together; especially the Stuck, which must be beaten and mix'd till
it will not stick to the Trowel.</p>

<p>They took likewise a great deal of Pains to run several times
over and beat the Plaster, which gave it a Hardness, a Whiteness,
and Polish'd it so well, that it shin'd like a Mirror.</p>

<p>These Plasterings so made, serve to Paint in <i>Fresco</i> upon;
for the Colours being laid upon the Mortar before it was dry,
pierced it, and Embodied with it; so that the Painting could not be
defaced though it were wash'd; which would easily be wash'd off if
the Mortar were dry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id=
"Page_61">61</a></span> They likewise laid these Plasterings upon
Partitions of Wood filled with fat Earth, nailing Reeds to them, as
we do Laths, and daubing it over with Clay, and then putting on
another row of Reeds across upon the former, and another Bed of fat
Earth or Clay, upon which they laid Beds of Mortar and Stuck, as we
have said before.</p>

<p>For the Plastering of low and moist places, they had a great
many other <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 7.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;4.</i></span> Precautions, especially within the House;
for as what belonged to the Out-part of the House, they contented
themselves to Plaster from the Bottom of the Wall to the height of
three Feet, with Cement.</p>

<p>But as to the Inward-parts of the House, when the Ground without
was higher than the lowermost Flooring; they run up a little narrow
Wall against the great one, leaving betwixt the two Walls only the
distance of a Channel or Sewer, which they made lower than the
Flooring, to receive the Water which might be gather'd against the
Walls, and let it run out;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">62</a></span> and to the End they might hinder the
gathering of much Water, by the Vapours which might be enclosed
between these two Walls, they made towards the top of the little
Wall Vents to let it out, and this little Wall was Plastered on the
Out-side with Mortar and Stuck, as we have said before.</p>

<p>When the Place was too narrow to permit those Counter-Walls to
be made within, they put hollow Tiles one upon another against the
Wall, and placed and plaster'd them over with Mortar and Stuck.
These Tiles which were Pitch'd over within, and were Demi-Channels,
let the Water fall down into the Sewer, which sweat from the great
Wall, and so let all the Vapours, which were engendred by Humidity,
go out at the Vents.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />
Pr&aelig;s.</i></span> <img src="images/capital_o.png" class=
"floatLeft" alt="O" />NE of the Principal Things the Architect
ought to consider, is the Convenience of the place where he would
Build the Fabrick. This is the reason that <i>Dinocrates</i> was
blamed by <i>Alexander</i>, for having propos'd him an Excellent
Design for Building a City in a Barren place, and incapable of
Nourishing those who were to Inhabit it.</p>

<p>We must then choose a place that is fertile, and hath abundance
of every thing; and which hath likewise Rivers and Ports capable of
furnishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id=
"Page_64">64</a></span> it with all the Product and Commodities of
the adjacent Countries.</p>

<p>The Third thing to be considered is, whether the Air be
wholesome; and for this End, we must choose a high situated place,
that it may be less Subject to Fogs and Mists; it must be likewise
far from all Morasses, because the Corruption that may be caused by
the infectious Breath of Venomous Beasts which commonly are
ingendred there, makes the place very unwholsom, unless these
Morasses be near the Sea, and situated high, that the Water may
fall easily from them into the Sea, and that the Sea may likewise
sometimes overflow them, and by its Saltness kill all the Venomous
Beasts.</p>

<p>It is likewise to be remark'd, That a City situated upon the
Sea, must needs have an unwholsom Air, if it be towards the South
or the West; for generally the Heat weakens Bodies, and the Cold
strengthens them; and so we see by Experience, that those who go
out of a Cold Country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id=
"Page_65">65</a></span> into an Hot, have great difficulty to keep
themselves in Health; whereas on the contrary, the Inhabitants of
Hot Countries who go into Colder, have generally good Health.</p>

<p>The Ancients were accustomed to judge of the Quality of the Air,
Water and Fruits, which might render a place wholsome by the
Constitution of the Bodies of those Beasts which were nourished
there, and to this End they consulted their Entrails; for if the
Liver was Corrupted, they conjectured that the same thing must
happen to Men that should Inhabit in that place.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Form and Situation of the
Building.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_a.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=

out according to the most Advantageous Aspect of the Heavens, and
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id=
"Page_66">66</a></span> <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span> best way will be to lay the Streets out
so, that the Wind may not come directly into them, especially where
the Winds are great and cold.</p>

<p>The Prospect of Private Mens Houses is made more or less
Commodious, by the Openings which are differently made, to receive
the Air and the Light according to the Quality of the Parts that
are in the Fabrick.</p>

<p>For the Cellars, Granaries, and generally all places that we
wou'd <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;9.</i></span> Lock up, or keep any thing in, should be
exposed to the North, and receive very few Rays of the Sun.</p>

<p>The different Use of the Parts which Compose the Buildings, do
likewise require different Situations; for the Dining-Rooms in
Winter, and the Baths among the Ancients, were always turned to the
West, for that Situation made them warmer, because the Sun then
shone upon them, about <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;7.</i></span> the time they were wont to make use of
those Apartments.</p>

<p>The Libraries ought to be turned to the rising Sun, because they
are generally made use of in the Morning;<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span> besides, the Books are
not so much damnified in Libraries so situated, as in those which
are turned to the South and West, which are subject to Worms and a
certain Humidity which engenders Moldiness, and consequently
destroys the Books.</p>

<p>The Dining-Rooms for the Spring and Autumn, should be turned
towards the East, to the end, that being covered from the great
force the Sun hath when it is near Setting, they may be cooler
about the time they are to be made use of.</p>

<p>The Summer Apartments must be turned to the North, that they may
be fresher and cooler.</p>

<p>This Situation is likewise very proper for Closets, which are
adorn'd with Pictures for the Light which is always equal,
represents the Colours always alike.</p>

<p>There must likewise great respect be had to the difference of
Climates, for the Excess of Heat and Cold, require different
Situations and Structures; for the Houses in the Northern parts of
the World, ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id=
"Page_68">68</a></span> be Vaulted, and have few Openings, and
turn'd to the South; On the contrary in Hot Countries there must be
great Openings and turn to the North; to the End that Art and
Industry may remedy the Defects of the place.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Disposition of Fabricks</i>.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
Disposition or Distribution of Fabricks contributes much to their
Convenience, when each thing is so plac'd, that it is in a Proper
place for the Use for which the Fabrick is Design'd; and for this
reason the Town-House and the Market-Place <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span> ought to be in the Middle of the City,
unless it happen that there be a Port or a River; for the Market
ought not to be far distant from those places where the Merchandize
is.</p>

<p>The Houses of Private Men, ought to be differently disposed,
according to the divers Conditions of those that<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span> Dwell in
them: For in the Houses of Great Men, the Apartments of the Lord,
must not be at the Entry, where ought to be nothing but
<i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>, <i>Courts</i>, <i>Peristyles</i>,
<i>Halls</i>, and <i>Gardens</i> to receive the great Number of
those who have Business with them, and make their Court to
them.</p>

<p>The Houses of Merchants ought to have at the Entry their
<i>Shops</i> and <i>Magazines</i>, and all other places where
Strangers are to come about their Business.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;9.</i></span> The Country Houses ought to have a
different Order and Disposition from those of the City.</p>

<p>For the Kitchen ought to be near the Ox-house, so that from
their Cratches they may see the Chimney and the rising Sun; for
this makes the Oxen more Beautiful, and makes their Hair lie
better.</p>

<p>The Baths ought likewise to be near the Kitchen, that the Water
may be more conveniently heated.</p>

<p>The Press ought not to be far from the Kitchen, for that will
much facilitate the Service that is necessary<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> for the
Preparation of Olives. If the Press be made of Wooden Beams, it
ought to have at least for 16 Foot Breadth, 40 Foot of Length, if
there be but one; or 24, if there be 2.</p>

<p>Not far from the Press, must the Cellar be plac'd, whose Windows
must be turned to the North, because the heat spoils the Wine.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Place where the Oil is kept, ought to be
turned to the South; to the End, the gentle heat of the Sun may
keep the Oil from freezing.</p>

<p>The Houses for Sheep and Goats ought to be so large, that each
of them may at least have 4 Foot for his place.</p>

<p>The Stables must likewise be Built near the House in a warm
place, but not turned towards the Chimney; for Horses that often
see the Fire, are generally ill Coated.</p>

<p>The Barns and Granaries, as likewise the Mills, ought to be at a
pretty distance from the House, because of the Danger of Fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id=
"Page_71">71</a></span>In all sorts of Fabricks, a particular Care
must be taken that they be well lighted; but the Light is
principally necessary in the <i>Stair-Cases</i>, <i>Passages</i>,
and <i>Dining-Rooms</i>.</p>

<hr />
<h3>ART. IV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Convenient Form of
Buildings.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_w.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="W" />HEN
we are assur'd of the Convenience of the place where the City is to
be Built, by the Knowledge we have of the goodness of the Air, of
its Fertility, Rivers and Ports, care must be taken to make
Fortifications, which do not only consist in the Solidity of the
Walls and Ramparts, but principally in their Form.</p>

<p>The Figure or Form of a place ought neither to be Square, nor
Composed of Angles too far advanc'd, but it must have a great
number of Corners, to the end the Enemy may be<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> seen from
all Parts; for the Angles that are so far advanc'd, are ill to be
defended, and more favourable to the Besiegers than the Besieged.
The Approach to the Walls must be made as difficult as
possible.</p>

<p>The most Convenient Form of Publick Places, is to have in their
Breadth 2 Thirds of their Length; The <i>Greeks</i> made about
their Publick places <i>Double Portico&rsquo;s</i>, with Pillars
near together, which Supported the Galleries above.</p>

<p>But the <i>Romans</i> finding this great number of Pillars to be
inconvenient, placed them at a greater distance one from another,
that they might have Shops well lighted.</p>

<p>The Stair-Cases of all Publick Buildings, ought to be large and
streight, and to have many Entrances, to the End the People may
come in and out conveniently; but we shall <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> speak of this more largely in another
place.</p>

<p>The Halls where great Assemblies are to meet, ought to have
their <i>Ceiling</i> very high, and to give them
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.<br />

<i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span> their true
Proportion, we must unite the Length and Breadth, and give the half of the whole for the height of
the <i>Ceiling</i>. The Halls where the <i>Ceiling</i> is not so
high, must have only their breadth, and half of their length for
their height.</p>

<p>In vast and high places, to remedy the Inconvenience of the
noisy Echo, about the middle of the height of the Wall, must be
made a <i>Cornish</i> round about to break the course of the Voice;
which without that, beating <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> against the Walls, would beat a Second
time against the <i>Ceiling</i>, and cause a troublesom double
Echo.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Beauty of Buildings.</i></div>

<hr />
<h3>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>In what the Beauty of Building
Consists.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_b.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=
"B" /><i>Uildings</i> may have two sorts of Beauty, the one
<i>Positive</i>, and the other <i>Arbitrary</i>. <i>Positive
Beauty</i>, is that which necessarily pleaseth of her self;
<i>Arbitrary</i>, is that which doth not necessarily please of her
self, but her agreeableness depends upon the Circumstances that
accompany her.</p>

<p><i>Positive Beauty</i>, consists in Three principal Things;
<i>viz.</i> In the Equality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">75</a></span> of the Relation that the Parts have one
to another, which is called <i>Symmetry</i>, in the Richness of the
Materials, in the Properness, Neatness, and Exactness of the
Performance.</p>

<p>As to what regards the Relation of the Parts of the Fabrick one
to another, <i>Vitruvius</i> hath not spoke of it, but only where
he prefers the <i>Netway</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
2.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;8.<br /><br />
Lib. 1.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.<br /><br />
Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;11.</i></span> of Walling before all other sorts of
<i>Masonry</i>, because of the Uniformity that is in that Figure,
and the laying of the Stones; As to the Richness of the Materials,
he leaves the Disposition to him that is at the Expences of the
Building; and he acknowledges that the Beauty of the Performance
depends wholly upon the Dexterousness and Industry of the
Workmen.</p>

<p>The second sort of <i>Beauty</i>, which only pleases by the
Circumstances that accompany it, is of two sorts; The one is called
<i>Wisdom</i>, and the other <i>Regularity</i>. <i>Wisdom</i>
consists in the reasonable use of <i>Positive Beauties</i>, which
result from the use and convenient ranking of the Parts; for
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76">76</a></span> Perfection of which, to a rich and precious
Material, is given an Equal and Uniform Figure, with all the
Property and Correctness possible.</p>

<p><i>Vitruvius</i> gives us two Examples of this sort of
<i>Beauty</i>; The first is, When <i>Bosses</i> or
<i>Relievo&rsquo;s</i> are made to hide the Joynts, putting them
directly under the <i>Bosses</i> which hide them by their jetting
or projecture, for this gives them great Beauty and an agreeable
Aspect.</p>

<p>The second is, When we consider the Winter-Appartments, that we
have a care, that upon the Ceiling there be little or no Carving,
and that the Ornaments be not made of Stuck, because it hath a
shining whiteness, which will not endure the least nastiness; for
it is impossible to hinder the smoak of the Fire and Candles which
are lighted in the Winter, from tarnishing the beautiful Colour of
the Work to which the Filth will stick, and enter into the Crevises
of the Carving, which cannot be wiped out.</p>

<p>The <i>Regularity</i> depends upon the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> Observation of the Laws
which are Established for the Proportions of all the Parts of
<i>Architecture</i>, the Observation of these Laws extreamly
pleases those that understand <i>Architecture</i>, who love these
Proportions for two Reasons.</p>

<p>The First is, That they are for the most part founded upon
Reason; which requires, for example, that the parts that support
and are under, be stronger than those above; as we see in
<i>Pedestalls</i>, which are broader than the Pillars they support,
and they are broader at the bottom than the top.</p>

<p>The other Motive is <i>Prevention</i>, which is one of the most
usual Foundations of the <i>Beauty</i> of all things, for even as
we love the Fashion of the Cloaths which the Courtiers wear,
although this mode have no <i>Positive Beauty</i>, but only for the
Positive Merit of the Persons that wear them; so we are accustomed
to love the Proportions of the Members of <i>Architecture</i>,
rather because of the great Opinion that we have of them that
Invented them, than for any <i>Positive</i><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> <i>Beauty</i> which is
found in the Works of the Ancients, where these Proportions are
observ'd; for often these Proportions are against Reason; as we may
see in the <i>Thorus</i> of the <i>Ionick Base</i>, in the
<i>Faces</i> of <i>Architraves</i> and <i>Chambranles</i>, or
<i>Door-Cases</i>, with their <i>Mouldings</i>, where the Strong is
supported by the Weak, and many other things, which Custom only
hath made supportable.</p>

<p>These Proportions appertain to Three principal Members, which
are <i>Pillars</i>, <i>Piedements</i>, <i>Chambranles</i>; the
<i>Pillars</i> taken Generically, and as opposite to
<i>Piedements</i>, and <i>Chambranles</i> or <i>Door-Cases</i>,
have Three parts, <i>viz.</i> The <i>Pedestal</i>, the
<i>Pillar</i>, and the <i>Ornaments</i>. Every one of these Parts
is likewise divided into Three other Parts, for the <i>Pedestal</i>
is composed of the <i>Basis</i>, its <i>Die</i> and its
<i>Cornish</i>; the <i>Pillar</i> Comprehends its <i>Base</i>,
<i>Shaft</i> and <i>Capital</i>. The <i>Ornaments</i> consist in
the <i>Architrave</i>, <i>Frise</i>, and <i>Corniche</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Piedement</i> or <i>Fronton</i>, has likewise Three
Parts, <i>viz.</i> The <i>Tympan</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> the <i>Corniches</i>, and the
<i>Acroteres</i>. The <i>Chambranle</i> or <i>Door-Case</i> is
composed of two <i>Pieds-droits</i>, or <i>Piers</i>, and the
<i>Lintel</i> which also supports a <i>Frise</i>, which has
likewise its <i>Cornich</i>.</p>

<p>The Disposition, Form, and different Proportions of all the
Parts make two things, to which all that is Beautiful in Building
hath a Relation, which is <i>Gender</i> and <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gender</i> depends of the Proportion, which is between the
thickness of the <i>Pillars</i> and the space betwixt them.</p>

<p><i>Order</i>, doth likewise depend in part upon the Proportion
which is between the thickness of the <i>Pillars</i>, and their
height; but we must likewise joyn to this Proportion many other
things that appertain to the principal Parts of the <i>Pillars</i>,
and other Parts which accompany it, such as are the <i>Gates</i>,
the <i>Chambranles</i>, or <i>Door-Cases</i>; and other things
which are different in different <i>Orders</i>.</p>

<h3>ART. II.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Five sorts of Fabricks</i>.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=
"T" />HERE are Five sorts of Fabricks; The First is called
<i>Pycnostyle</i>, viz. where the Pillars are very close one to
another, in such a Proportion that there is but from one Pillar to
another, the space of a Diameter and half of the Pillar. See the
<i>Fig.</i> AA. <a href="#p_2"><i>Tab.</i> 2.</a></p>

<p>The Second is called <i>Systile</i>, viz. where the Pillars seem
to be joyned together, are notwithstanding a little more distant
one from another than in the <i>Pycnostile</i>; for the
intercolumniation is two Diameters of the Pillars.</p>

<p>The Defect that is observ'd in the <i>Systile</i> as well as in
the <i>Pycnostile</i> is, that the Entrance of the Fabricks which
are placed in that distance are very narrow: So that
<i>Vitruvius</i> remarks that the Ladies as they walk<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> to the
Temple hand in hand, were forced when they came thither to quit
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 2.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> one another, because they could not go two
a Breast between the Pillars. See the Figure BB. <a href=
"#p_2">Tab. II.</a></p>

<p>The Third is called <i>Diastyle</i>; <i>viz.</i> where the
Pillars are further distant, the space of the Intercolumniation
being three Diameters, and the Inconvenience is, that the space is
so great, that the <i>Architraves</i> which lie upon the two
Pillars are in danger of breaking; because the Ancients made them
of one Stone. See Figure CC. <a href="#p_2">Tab. II.</a></p>

<p>The Fourth is called <i>Areostyle</i>; <i>viz.</i> where the
Pillars are set very thin, there is no certain Proportion, but the
distance of one Pillar from another, <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;8.</i></span> is much greater than that of
<i>Diastyle</i>; and for this reason it can have no
<i>Architrave</i> but of Wood. See the Figure DD. <a href=
"#p_2">Tab. II.</a></p>

<p>The Fifth is called <i>Eustyle</i>; <i>viz.</i> where the
Pillars are distant from one another by a more convenient
Proportion than in any of the other kind. The distance consists of
two Diameters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">82</a></span> of the Pillars, and one Fourth part of the
Diameter: It has also this in particular, That the
Intercolumniation in the middle is larger than the rest, having
three Diameters of the Pillars; for this reason it surpasseth all
others in Beauty, Solidity, and Convenience. See <a href=
"#p_3">Tab. III.</a></p>

<p>Although the Essentials of these five Kinds, consist in the
Proportion that is between the Diameter of the Pillar, and its
Intercolumniation, they are also different by the Proportion which
is between the Diameter of the Pillar and its height for the
<i>Genders</i> or sorts, in which the Pillars are close one to
another, ought to have the lesser Pillars; and in that kind, where
the Pillars are in a greater distance one from another, they ought
to be greater.</p>

<p><span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib.</i> 4.<br />
<i>Cap.</i> 7.</span>But it&rsquo;s true, notwithstanding that these Proportions are
not always observ'd, and that very often, to the <i>Ionick</i> and
<i>Corinthian</i> Pillars, which are the smallest of all,
Intercolumniations are given, which are proper to those of the <i>Thuscan Order</i>, where
the Pillars are the greatest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id=
"Page_83">83</a></span>But the Ordinary Practice is, to <span
class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
 Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> give to the Pillars of the
<i>Areostyle</i> kind, the Magnitude of the 8th part of their
height.</p>

<p>As to the <i>Diastyle</i> and <i>Eustyle</i>, the height is
divided into Eight parts and an half, to give one to the
breadth.</p>

<p>In the <i>Systyle</i> Kind, the Height is divided into Nine
parts and an half, and one is given to the thickness.</p>

<p>In the <i>Picnostyle</i>, the thickness of the Pillar is the
10th part of the height, the reason of these different Proportions
is founded upon this, that these Pillars do seem to lose of their
thickness according as they are in Proportion great or long; and
it&rsquo;s likewise for this Reason, that it is thought convenient
to have the Pillars in the Corners thicker by a 50th part. See <a
href="#p_2">Tab. II.</a> and <a href="#p_3">Tab. III.</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Five Orders of
Architecture</i>.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
Five Orders of Architecture are, the <i>Thuscan</i>, the
<i>Dorick</i>, the <i>Ionick</i>, the <i>Corinthian</i>, and the
<i>Compound</i>.</p>

<p>These Orders were Invented to satisfie the Design that might be
had of making Fabricks more or less Massy, and more or less
adorn'd, for the Distinction of these Orders consists in two
things, that as the <i>Thuscan</i> and <i>Dorick</i> Order are more
massy and less adorn'd, so the <i>Corinthian</i> and
<i>Compound</i> are Slenderer and Richer, the <i>Ionick</i> holds
the Middle, as well in its Proportions, as its Ornaments, being
less massy and more adorn'd than the <i>Thuscan</i> and the
<i>Dorick</i>, and more massy and less adorn'd than the
<i>Compound</i> and the <i>Corinthian</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id=

Architecture into Three Orders; <i>viz.</i> The <i>Dorick</i>, the

forget to give the Proportions of the <i>Thuscan</i>, and speak of
the <i>Compound</i>.</p>

<hr />
<h3>ART. IV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of Things that are Common to several
Orders.</i></div>

<p>Before we treat of the Differences of these Five Orders, it
would be proper to speak of those Things that are common to several
Orders; as are the <i>Steps</i>, <i>Pedestals</i>, the
<i>Diminution of Pillars</i>, their <i>Channelling</i>,
<i>Piedements</i>, <i>Cornices</i>, and <i>Acroteres</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Steps</i> which are before the Temple, ought always to be
of an <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> the end, that having put the right Foot in
mounting the first <i>Step</i>, it may likewise be upon the
last.</p>

<p>They ought not to be more than 6 Inches 10 Lines high, nor less
than 6 Inches.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id=
"Page_86">86</a></span>Their breadth ought to be proportion'd to
their height, and this Proportion ought to be of 3 to 4; so that if
the <i>Steps</i> be 6 parts high, which is <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 9.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> 3 times 2, they must be 8 broad, which is
4 times 2; following the Proportion of a Triangular Rectangle
invented by <i>Pythagoras</i>.</p>

<p>The Landing-places ought not to be narrower than 16 Inches and
an <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> half, nor broader than 22 Inches, and all
the <i>Steps</i> that are round about a Fabrick should be all of
the same breadth.</p>

<p>The <i>Pedestals</i> which support many Pillars of the same
Rank, will be much handsomer if one make them jet out before every
Pillar like a Joynt-Stool; for otherwise, if the <i>Bases</i> were
all of one size, they would resemble a Channel.</p>

<p>If Leaning-places, or Elbow-places are to be betwixt the
<i>Pedestals</i>, it&rsquo;s necessary that they be as high as the
<i>Pedestals</i>, and that the <i>Cornices</i> of the
<i>Pedestals</i>, and of the Leaning or Elbow-places be equal, and
have a true Proportion one to another.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id=
"Page_87">87</a></span>All the Pillars ought to go diminishing
towards the top, to augment their Strength, and render them more
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.</i> 5.<br />
<i>Chap.</i> 1.</span> Beautiful, imitating the Bodies of Trees,
which are greater at the Bottom than at the Top. But this
<i>Diminution</i> must be lesser in the great Pillars which have
their highest part further from the Sight, and which by Consequence
makes them at the top seem lesser, according to the ordinary Effect
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.</i> 3.<br />
<i>Chap.</i> 2.</span> of Perspective; which always diminisheth
Objects according to the measure that they are distant from the
Eye.</p>

<p>The Rule of this different <i>Diminution</i> is, that a Pillar
that is 15 Foot high, ought to have in the upper part 5 parts of 6
in the which the Diameter of the <i>Base</i> of the Pillar is
divided; that which is from 15 to 20 Foot, ought to have 5 and an
half of the 6 and an half of the Diameter; that which is from 20 to
30, ought to have 6 of the 7 parts of the Diameter; that which is
from 30 to 40, must have 6 and an half of 7 and an half of the
Diameter; that which is from 40 to<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span> 50, must have 7 of 8 of the
Diameter. These <i>Diminutions</i> do not belong to the <i>Thuscan
Order</i>, whose Pillars are much more diminished; as we shall show
hereafter.</p>

<p>Besides this <i>Diminution</i> which is made towards the top of
the Pillar, there is another below, which makes the Pillar about
the middle swell like a Belly; the measure of this <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> swelling is taken from the magnitude which
makes up the Distance between the <i>Channels</i>.</p>

<p>There is another sort of <i>Diminution of Pillars</i>, which is
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span>made of one Pillar in respect of another; It is of 2 sorts,
<i>viz.</i> when a second rank is placed upon the first, for then
the second Pillar must be lesser a fourth part than those below, or
when <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i> are made that have Pillars in the
Corners, for those in the middle must be less than
those in the Corners, a 50th part.</p>

<p>The <i>Channellings</i> are so called, because they are as it
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span>were <i>Demi-Channels</i>, which descend from the top of the Pillar
to the bottom; they represented the Plaites of the Garments<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of Women, which the Pillars resembled.</p>

<p>There are three sorts of <i>Channellings</i>, the two first are
particular and proper to the <i>Dorick Order</i>; the third is
common to the <i>Ionick</i>, <i>Corinthian</i> <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
 Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> and <i>Compound</i>: The two first are
more plain and simple, and fewer in number than the others.</p>

<p>The most Simple is that which is not hollowed at all, and which
hath only <i>Pans</i> and flat Fronts or Faces.</p>

<p>The other is a little hollowed; to make this hollowness, a
Square must be made, whose Side must be equal to the <i>Pan</i>, in
which the <i>Channelling</i> is to be made, and having put one foot
of the Compass in the middle <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> of the Square, make a crooked Line from
one Angle of the <i>Channelling</i> to the other, both these
<i>Channellings</i> are made up to the number of Twenty.</p>

<p><span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i><br /><br />
<i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;4.</i></span>The other Orders have 24, and sometimes 32, when it is design'd
to make the Pillars seem greater than they are; for the Eye judgeth that all
things are greater when they have more and different Marks, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
lead as it were the Sight to more Objects at once.</p>

<p>These <i>Channellings</i> are deeper than those of the <i>Dorick
Order</i>, and the depth ought to be just so much, that a
Carpenter&rsquo;s Rule being put into the Cavity, touch with its
Angle the bottom, and with its sides the two Corners of the
<i>Channelling</i>. <i>Vitruvius</i> hath not taught us what the
Proportions of the <i>Channelling</i> should be, in respect of the
<i>Fillet</i> which makes up the space between the
<i>Channellings</i>, nor what the breadth of the <i>Fillet</i>
should be, which he hath establish'd for the rule of the swelling
Belly of the Pillar.</p>

<p>The <i>Piedement</i> is composed of a <i>Tympan</i> and
<i>Cornices</i>; to have the true height of the <i>Tympan</i>, we
must divide the breadth which is between the two ends of the
<i>Cymatium</i> of the <i>Larmier</i>, or <i>Drip</i> which
supports the <i>Piedement</i>, into 9 parts, and give one to the
<i>Tympan</i>.</p>

<p>The thickness of the <i>Cornice</i> being added to this 9th
part, makes up the height of the whole <i>Piedement</i> or
<i>Fronton</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id=
"Page_91">91</a></span>The <i>Tympan</i> ought to be Perpendicular
upon the <i>Gorge</i> of the Pillar, the things that are common to
all <i>Cornices</i> are, that the <i>Cornice</i> of the
<i>Piedement</i> must be equal to that below, excepting the last
great <i>Cymatium</i>, which ought not to be upon the
<i>Cornice</i> below the <i>Piedement</i>, but it ought to go over
the <i>Cornices</i> which are sloping upon the <i>Piedement</i> or
<i>Fronton</i>.</p>

<p>This great <i>Cymatium</i> ought to have of height an 8th part
more than the <i>Crown</i>, or <i>Drip</i>, or <i>Larmier</i>.</p>

<p>In places where there are no <i>Piedements</i>, in the great
<i>Cymatiums</i> of the <i>Cornices</i>, must be cut the Heads of
Lions, at such a distance, that there must be one directly upon
every Pillar, and that the other answer directly upon the great
<i>Dalles</i>, that cover the House. These Heads of Lions are
pierced through to convey the Water which falls from the Roof upon
the <i>Cornice</i>: The Heads of the Lions which are not directly
upon the Pillars, ought not to be pierced, to the end the Water may
flow with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">92</a></span> greater impetuosity through those which are
directly upon the Pillars, and that it may not fall between the
Pillars upon those who are to go into the
<i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Greeks</i> in their great Buildings never put any
<i>Dentels</i> under the <i>Modillons</i>, because the
<i>Rafters</i> could not be under the <i>Forces</i>, or
<i>Sheers</i>, and it is a great fault that That, which according
to the true Rules of Building ought to be placed above, should be
placed under in the Representation.</p>

<p>For this Reason, the Ancients never approved of <i>Modillons</i>
in the <i>Piedements</i>, nor of <i>Dentels</i>, but only simple
<i>Cornices</i>; for neither the <i>Forces</i>, <i>Sheers</i>, nor
the <i>Rafters</i> can be represented in the <i>Piedements</i>, out
of which they cannot jet but only directly out of the Eaves of the
House upon which they lie sloping.</p>

<p>The <i>Acroteres</i> are three <i>Pedestals</i>, which are upon
the Corners and Middle of the <i>Piedement</i> to support Statues;
those of the Corner ought to be as high as the Middle of the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
<i>Tympan</i>; but the <i>Acrotere</i> in the middle ought to be
higher by an 8th part than the other.</p>

<p>All the Members or Parts which shall be placed upon the Capitals
of Pillars, <i>viz. Architraves</i>, <i>Frises</i>,
<i>Cornices</i>, <i>Tympans</i>, and <i>Acroteres</i>, should
encline forward the 12th part of their height.</p>

<p>There is likewise another General Rule; which is, that all the
parts that jet out, should have their Projecture equal to their
Height.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the</i> Thuscan <i>Order.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_i.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="I" />T
hath been said that all Buildings have three Parts, which may be
different according to the divers Order, <i>viz.</i> The
<i>Pillars</i>, the <i>Piedements</i>, and the <i>Chambranles</i>,
or <i>Door-Cases</i>; and that the <i>Pillars</i> had three Parts,
which are the <i>Pedestal</i>, the <i>Shaft</i>, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span> its
Ornaments, <i>viz.</i> The <i>Architrave</i>, the <i>Frise</i> and
the <i>Cornice</i>.</p>

<p>Neither the Proportion of the <i>Pedestals</i>, nor of the
<i>Gates</i> and <i>Chambranles</i> of the <i>Thuscan Order</i> are
to be found in <i>Vitruvius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;7.</i></span> The Proportion of the Pillar is this, that
its thickness below is the 7th part of its height, it&rsquo;s
Diminution is the 4th part of the Diameter of the Pillar, its
<i>Base</i> has half of the Diameter of the Pillar for its height,
the <i>Plinthus</i> being round, makes one half of the <i>Base</i>;
the other half is for the <i>Thorus</i>, and for the <i>Conge</i>
or <i>Apophygis</i>, Vid. <i>Conge</i> explained.</p>

<p>The height of the Capital is half the Diameter of the Pillar,
the breadth of the <i>Abacus</i> is equal to the whole Diameter of
the Pillar at the bottom, the height of the Capital is divided into
three Parts; one of them is allowed the <i>Plinthus</i>, which
serves instead of an <i>Abacus</i>; the <i>Echine</i> hath another;
and a third Part is for the <i>Gorge</i> of the Capital
comprehending the <i>Astragal</i>, the <i>Conge</i>, or
<i>Apophygis</i>, which are immediately under the
<i>Echine</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=
"Page_95">95</a></span>Upon the Pillars must be laid the
<i>Sabliers</i>, or <i>Wooden Architrave</i>, joyned together by
<i>Tenons</i>, in the form of a Swallows Tail.</p>

<p>These <i>Sabliers</i> ought to be distant one from another about
an Inch; for if they should touch one another, the Timber would
heat and corrupt.</p>

<p>Upon these <i>Sabliers</i> which serve for an <i>Architrave</i>,
must be built a little Wall, which will serve instead of a
<i>Frise</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Cornice</i> which is laid upon this little Wall or
<i>Frise</i>, has <i>Mutal&rsquo;s</i> which jet out.</p>

<p>All the Crowning should have the 4th part of the height of the
Pillar. The little Walls that are built between the ends of the

<i>Dorick</i> Pillar has had in divers times, and in different
Buildings, different Proportions; for at first it had only for its
height 6 times its Diameter; this Proportion imitating that of
Humane Bodies, in <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.</i> 4.<br />
<i>Chap.</i> 1.</span> which the length of the Foot is the 6th part
of all the Body, afterwards they allowed 7 times its Diameter.</p>

<p>But this Proportion that the Pillars of the Temples had at the
Beginning, was afterwards changed in that of the Theaters, where
they were higher by half a Diameter; for they made them 15 Modules
high, for in the <i>Dorick <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.</i>
5.<br />
<i>Chap.</i> 9.</span> Order</i> the Semi-Diameter of the Pillar at
the bottom is the Module, which in other Orders is a whole
Diameter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id=
"Page_97">97</a></span>The <i>Dorick</i> Pillar is composed as well
as the rest of a <i>Shaft</i>, <i>Base</i> and <i>Capital</i>,
though <i>Vitruvius</i> makes no mention of the <i>Base</i>; and
it&rsquo;s easie to conclude, that in the Ancient Buildings this
<i>Order</i> had none; for it is said, That when they would make
the <i>Ionick Order</i> more Beautiful than the <i>Dorick</i>, they
added a <i>Base</i> to it; <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span> and there is yet to be seen in Ancient
Buildings of this Order, Pillars without a <i>Base</i>; but when a
<i>Base</i> is added to it, it must be <i>Attick Base</i>, whose
Proportion is as follows.</p>

<p>The whole <i>Base</i> ought to have a <i>Module</i> for its
height; that is to say, half the Diameter of the Pillar; this
<i>Module</i> being divided into three parts; one is for the
<i>Plinthus</i>; the other two parts are divided into four, of
which one is allowed for the upper <i>Torus</i>, the three which
remain, are divided into two: The half below is for the lower
<i>Torus</i>, the other is for the <i>Scoti&aelig;</i>, comprising
the two little Squares or Filets. The breadth of the <i>Basis</i>
in General is a 4th of the Diameter of the Pillar at the bottom,
added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id=
"Page_98">98</a></span> on every side; but this jetting is
excessive, and without any Example, and <i>Vitruvius</i> himself
makes it lesser in the <i>Ionick Base</i>.</p>

<p>The height of the <i>Capital</i> as well as the <i>Base</i> is
one <i>Module</i>, the breadth is two <i>Modules</i> and an half,
the height of the <i>Capital</i> being divided into three parts,
one must be allowed for the <i>Plinthus</i> or <i>Abacus</i>, with
its <i>Cymatium</i>; <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> the other is for the <i>Echine</i>, with
its <i>Anulets</i>; the third appertains to the <i>Gorge</i> of the
<i>Capital</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Architrave</i> which comprehends its <i>Platte-Band</i>
with the <i>Gouttes</i> or <i>Pendant Drops</i>, which are under
the <i>Triglyphs</i>, is as well as the <i>Capital</i> of one only
<i>Module</i>; the <i>Gouttes</i> or <i>Drops</i> with their little
<i>Tringle</i>, ought to have the 6th part of a <i>Module</i>, the
breadth under the <i>Architrave</i> ought to be equal to that above
the Pillar.</p>

<p>Upon the <i>Architrave</i> in the <i>Friese</i> ought to be the
<i>Triglyphs</i> and the <i>Metops</i>. The <i>Triglyphs</i> have a
<i>Module</i> and a half for their height, and a <i>Module</i> for
their breadth; the <i>Metops</i> are as high as broad; One
<i>Triglyph</i> must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id=
"Page_99">99</a></span> be placed directly upon every Pillar, and
the Intercolumniation ought to have three; towards the Corners must
be placed the <i>Demi-Metops</i>.</p>

<p>The breadth of the <i>Triglyph</i> being divided into six parts,
five of them must be left in the middle, and the two halfs which
remain on the right and the left, must be for <i>Demi-Graveurs</i>;
The part in the middle, and the two last of the five, must be for
the three Feet, and the two which are betwixt the three Feet, must
be for the <i>Graveurs</i> or <i>Channels</i>, which must be
hollowed, following the Corner of the <i>Mason</i>&rsquo;s Rule.
The <i>Capital</i> of the <i>Triglyph</i> ought to have the 6th.
part of a <i>Module</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the <i>Capital</i> of the <i>Triglyph</i> is placed the
great <i>Cornice</i>, its Jetting or Projecture, is half a
<i>Module</i> and the 6th. part of a <i>Module</i>, its height is
half a <i>Module</i>, comprising the <i>Dorick Cymatium</i>, which
is under it.</p>

<p>On the <i>Plat Fonds</i> of the <i>Cornice</i>, must be hollowed
little strait ways, which must answer perpendicularly to the sides
of the <i>Triglyphs</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">100</a></span> and the middle of the
<i>Metops</i>.</p>

<p>Streight upon the <i>Triglyphs</i> must be cut 9 <i>Goutes</i>
or <i>Drops</i>, which must be so distributed, that there may be
six length-wise, and three broad-wise; in the Spaces which are
betwixt the <i>Metops</i>, because they are greater than those
between the <i>Triglyphs</i>: nothing must be cut unless it be
<i>Foudres</i>. Moreover towards the border of the Crown must be
Carved a <i>Scotia</i>.</p>

<p>Some advance perpendicularly above the <i>Triglyphs</i>, the
Ends of the <i>Forces</i> or <i>Principals</i> to frame the
<i>Mutils</i> which support the <i>Cornices</i>; so that as the
Disposition of <i>Beams</i> hath caused the Invention of
<i>Triglyphs</i>, so the jetting of the <i>Forces</i> hath caused
the Disposition of the <i>Mutils</i>, which support the
<i>Cornices</i>. See <a href="#p_6">Tab. VI.</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the</i> Ionick <i>Order</i>.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />He
Proportion of the Pillars of the <i>Ionick Order</i> in the
beginning had Eight <i>Modules</i> or Diameters for their height,
but the Ancients quickly added half a Diameter, when to make this
Pillar more Beautiful than the <i>Dorick</i>, not only for its
height, but <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span> also for its Ornaments, they added a
<i>Base</i> to it, which was not used in the <i>Dorick
Order</i>.</p>

<p>The Pillars must be set upon their <i>Bases</i> two ways; for
sometimes they were perpendicularly set, and sometimes not,
<i>viz.</i> The outward rows of Pillars; when there were more Ranks
than one; for that part of the Pillar which is towards the Wall of
the Fabrick must necessarily be perpendicular, and the outward part
must have all the Diminution, and must lean towards the Wall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=
"Page_102">102</a></span> <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> The Pillars that are within the porch, and
are betwixt the Wall and the outward Pillar must stand
perpendicularly.</p>

<p>The breadth of the <i>Ionick Base</i> is the Diameter of the
Pillar, to which is added a 4th. and an 8th. part; its height is
half the Diameter; its height being divided into three parts, one
is allowed for the <i>Plinthus</i>, the rest being divided into
seven parts, three are allowed to the <i>Torus</i> above, after
equally dividing the four which remain, the two above are for the
upper <i>Scotia</i>, with its <i>Astragal</i>: The two below are
for the lower <i>Scotia</i>, which will appear greater than the
upper, because it extends to the edge of the <i>Plinthus</i>, the
<i>Astragals</i> must have the 8th. part of the <i>Scotia</i>,
whose Jetting or Projecture must be the 8th. part of the whole
<i>Base</i> joyned to the 6th. part of the Diameter of the Pillar.
See <a href="#p_7">Tab. VII.</a></p>

<p>As to the <i>Capital</i>, the <i>Abacus</i> must have in its
Square the Diameter of the bottom of the Pillar, adding to it an
18th. part; half of the <i>Abacus</i><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span> ought to be the height of
the <i>Capital</i>, comprizing the Round of the <i>Volute</i> or
<i>Scroll</i>, but there must be substracted from the corner of the
<i>Abacus</i> a 12th. part and an half of the height of the
<i>Capital</i>, and after the whole thickness of the <i>Capital</i>
must be divided into nine parts and an half, and one and an half
must be left for the thickness of the <i>Abacus</i>, that the
<i>Volutes</i> or <i>Scrolls</i> may be made of the eight which
remain; then having left under the <i>Abacus</i> four parts and an
half of these eight, a Line must be drawn in the place which cuts
the two a-cross and the Points of the Section shall be <i>Eyes</i>,
which shall have eight parts for their Diameter; in half the space
of the <i>Eye</i> shall be placed the Centers through which shall
be drawn with a Compass the Spiral-Line of the <i>Volute</i>,
beginning the height under the <i>Abacus</i>, and going into the
four Quarters of the Division, diminishing till we come directly to
the first Quarter, and giving to every Quarter a particular
Center.</p>

<p>Then the thickness of the whole <i>Capital</i><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span> must be
so divided that of nine parts which it contains, the <i>Volute</i>
has the breadth of three under the <i>Astragal</i>, on the top of
the Pillar, which must be directly upon the <i>Eye</i> of the
<i>Volute</i>, that which remains above the <i>Astragal</i>, must
be allowed for the <i>Abacus</i>, <i>Channel</i>, and the
<i>Echine</i> or <i>Egge</i>, whose jetting beyond the Square of
the <i>Abacus</i> must be of the same bigness of the <i>Echine</i>
or <i>Egge</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Channel</i> must be hollowed the 12th. part of its
breadth.</p>

<p>The <i>Girdle</i> or <i>Cincture</i>, or the lateral part of the
<i>Capital</i>, ought to advance out of the <i>Tailhoir Abacus</i>,
as much as it is from the Center of the <i>Eye</i> to the height of
the <i>Echine</i>.</p>

<p>The thickness of the <i>Axis</i> of the <i>Volutes</i>, which is
the thickness of the <i>Volute</i>, seen sideway, and which makes
up the extreme parts of that which is called commonly
<i>Balisters</i>, ought not to exceed the magnitude of the
<i>Eye</i>. See <a href="#p_7">Tab. VIII.</a></p>

<p>These Proportions of the <i>Ionick Capital</i>, are only for
Pillars of 15 Foot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id=
"Page_105">105</a></span> those that are greater require other, and
generally the greater Proportions are required for the Pillars that
are greater; and for this reason we have said, that the higher the
Pillars are, the less Diminution they must have; so when the
Pillars are above 15 Foot, we must add a 9th. part to the Diameter
of the Pillar for to give the breadth to the <i>Abacus</i>; to
which is never added more than an 18th. part to Pillars of 15
Foot.</p>

<p>The <i>Architraves</i> shall be laid upon the Pillars with
Jettings equal to the <i>Pedestals</i>, in case they be not all of
one size, but in form of Joint-Stools, to the end Symmetry may be
observ'd.</p>

<p>The height ought to be different, according to the proportion of
the height of the Pillar; for if the Pillar be from 12 to 15 Foot,
we must allow the <i>Architrave</i> the height of half a Diameter
of the bottom of the Pillar, if it be from 15 to 20, we must divide
the height of the Pillar into 15 parts, to the end we may allow one
to the <i>Architrave</i>; so if it be from 20<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span> to 25,
the height must be divided into 12 parts and an half, that the
<i>Architrave</i> may have one; and so proportionably.</p>

<p>The <i>Architrave</i> ought to have at the bottom which lies
upon the <i>Capital</i>, the same breadth that the top of the
Pillar hath under the <i>Capital</i>.</p>

<p>The Jetting of the <i>Cymatium</i> of the <i>Architrave</i>
ought to answer the bottom of the Pillar, the height of the
<i>Cymatium</i> ought to be the 7th. part of the whole
<i>Architrave</i>.</p>

<p>The rest being divided into 12 parts; three must be allowed to
the first <i>Face</i>, four to the second, and five to that above,
upon which is the <i>Cymatium</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Frise</i> ought not to be so high as the
<i>Architrave</i> by a 4th. part, unless something be carved there,
for then that the Carving may be more graceful, the <i>Frise</i>
ought to be bigger than the <i>Architrave</i> by a 4th. part.</p>

<p>Upon the <i>Frise</i> must be made a <i>Cymatium</i> of height
the 7th. part of the <i>Frise</i>, with a Jetting equal to its
height.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id=
"Page_107">107</a></span> The <i>Dentil</i> which is upon the
<i>Cymatium</i>, shall have the height of the <i>Face</i> of the
middle of the <i>Architrave</i>, with a Jetting or Projecture equal
to its height; the cutting of the <i>Dentils</i> ought to be so
made, that the breadth of every <i>Dentil</i> may be the half of
its height, and the Cavity of the cut which is between every
<i>Dentil</i> may have two parts of three, which maketh the breadth
of the <i>Dentil</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Cymatium</i> which is upon the <i>Dentil</i>, must have
the 3d. part of the height of the <i>Dentil</i>.</p>

<p>The Crown with its little <i>Cymatium</i> must have the same
height with the <i>Face</i> of the middle of the
<i>Architrave</i>.</p>

<p>The great <i>Cymatium</i> ought to have the height of an 8th.
part more than the <i>Crown</i> or <i>Drip</i>.</p>

<p>The Jetting or Projecture of the whole <i>Cornice</i>
comprehending the <i>Dentil</i> ought to be equal to the space that
there is from the <i>Frise</i>, just to the top of the great
<i>Cymatium</i>, and generally speaking all the Jettings or
Projectures shall have the better grace<span class='pagenum'><a

Pillars of the <i>Corinthian Order</i> have no other Proportions
than the <i>Ionick</i>, except in the <i>Capital</i>, whose height
make them appear slenderer and higher. The other parts or Members,
as the <i>Architrave</i>, <i>Frise</i>, and <i>Cornice</i>, borrow
their Proportions <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> from the <i>Dorick</i> and <i>Ionick
Order</i>, having nothing particular, for the <i>Corinthian
Modillons</i> are imitated by the <i>Mutils</i> of the <i>Dorick
Order</i>, and the <i>Dentils</i> are the same with the
<i>Ionick</i>; this being so, we have nothing to do but to give the
Proportions of the <i>Capital</i>, which are these; The
<i>Capital</i> comprizing the <i>Abacus</i>, hath for its height,
the breadth of the bottom of the Pillar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109">109</a></span>To have the true breadth of the
<i>Abacus</i>, we must have a care that its <i>Diagonal</i> be
double the height of the <i>Capital</i>, the bending that the sides
of the <i>Abacus</i> have inward, is a 9th. part of a side, the
bottom of the <i>Capital</i> is equal to the Neck of the Pillar.
The thickness of the <i>Abacus</i> is a 7th. part of the whole
<i>Capital</i>.</p>

<p>Two of these seven parts must be taken for the height of every
Leaf, of which there are two Ranks, each of which has four
Leaves.</p>

<p>The Stalks or little Branches are likewise composed of other
Leaves, and which grow between the Leaves of the Rank above, ought
to have two of these seven parts comprising the <i>Volutes</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Volutes</i> begin within the Stalks, of which, those
that are the greatest extend to the Extreme parts of the
<i>Angles</i> of the <i>Abacus</i>; the other are below the
<i>Roses</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Roses</i> which are in the middle of every <i>Face</i>
of the <i>Abacus</i>, ought to be as great as the <i>Abacus</i> is
thick.</p>

<p><img src="images/capital_v.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=

as of an <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.</i> 4.<br />
<i>Chap.</i> 1.</span> <i>Order</i> distinct from the
<i>Corinthian</i>, the <i>Ionick</i> and the <i>Dorick</i>; He only
tells us, that sometimes upon the <i>Corinthian Pillar</i> was
placed a <i>Capital</i> composed of several parts, which were taken
from the <i>Corinthian</i>, the <i>Ionick</i> and <i>Dorick
Orders</i>.</p>

<p>But a Consequence may be drawn from thence, that the
<i>Order</i> at present called the <i>Compound</i>, might have been
in use in the time of <i>Vitruvius</i>, although they then did not
make a distinct <i>Order</i> of it; Since that, our <i>Compound
Order</i> is not essentially different<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> from the
<i>Corinthian</i>, but by its <i>Capital</i>; and so one may say,
that this sole difference of the <i>Capital</i> ought to make it a
distinct <i>Order</i> from the <i>Corinthian</i>, since according
to <i>Vitruvius</i>, the <i>Corinthian Capital</i> alone, made the
<i>Corinthian Order</i>.</p>

<p>The parts that our <i>Compound Order</i> borrow from the
<i>Corinthian Order</i>, are the <i>Abacus</i>, and the two Ranks
of the Leaves of <i>Branch-Ursin</i>, which it has retained,
although the <i>Corinthian</i> have quitted them for the Leaves of
the <i>Olive</i>.</p>

<p>The other part that it takes from the <i>Ionick</i>, are the
<i>Volutes</i>; which it forms in some manner according to the
Model of the <i>Volutes</i> of the <i>Corinthian Order</i>, in
bending them even as the <i>Abacus</i>; for they are direct upon
the <i>Ionick Capital</i>, as well as the <i>Abacus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Echine</i>, or Quarter Round, which it has under the
<i>Abacus</i>, it borrows rather from the <i>Dorick Order</i>, than
from the <i>Ionick</i>; because this <i>Echine</i> is immediately
under the <i>Abacus</i>, as it is in the <i>Dorick Order</i>,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
which is not in the <i>Ionick</i>, which between the <i>Echine</i>
and the <i>Abacus</i>, places the <i>Channel</i> which makes the
<i>Volute</i>; it may notwithstanding be said, that it imitates the
<i>Echine</i> of the <i>Ionick Order</i>, in that it is cut with
<i>Oves</i> or <i>Eggs</i>, which is rarely found in the <i>Dorick
Capital</i>, but are always in the <i>Ionick</i>.</p>

<p>The Disposition and Figures of the Ramparts were so ordered,
that the Towers advanced out of the Walls to the end, that when the
Enemy approached them, the Besieged which were in the Towers, might
fall upon their Flank, both on the Right and the Left.</p>

<p>They took likewise great Care to make the Approaches to the
Walls difficult, ordering their Ways so, that they came not
directly, but to the Left of the Gate. For by this means, the
Besiegers were constrained to present to them that were upon the
Walls the Right side, which was not covered with a Buckler.</p>

<p>The Figure of a <i>strong</i> place ought neither to be Square,
nor composed of Angles that advance too far. But the Ancients made
them with many Sinuosities or Corners, for Angles that are too far
advanc'd, are more advantageous for the Besiegers, than the
Besieged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id=
"Page_115">115</a></span> The thickness of the Wall was so ordered,
that two Armed Men might walk by one another upon the Wall without
justling.</p>

<p>They made their Walls strong and durable, with sindged Beams of
Olive, which bound them and kept them up.</p>

<p>Although there be nothing that makes the Ramparts so strong as
Earth, they had not for all that the Custom of making Terrasses,
unless it were in some place where some Eminency was so near the
Wall, that the Besiegers might easily enter.</p>

<p>To make the Terrasses strong, and to hinder the Earth from
pushing down the two Walls that supported it, they made Buttresses
or Counter-forts which went from one Wall to another, to the end,
that the Earth being divided into many parts, might not have that
weight to push the Walls.</p>

<p>Their Towers were round, for those that are square are easily
ruin'd by their War-like Engines, and their Battering easily broke
down the Corners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id=
"Page_116">116</a></span> Directly against the Tower, the Wall was
cut off within the breadth of the Tower, and the Walls so
interrupted were only joyned with Joyces, which were not nailed
down; to the end, that if the Enemy made themselves Masters of some
part of the Wall, the Besieged might take up this Bridge made of
Joists, and hinder their further advance.</p>

<i>Chap.</i> 4.</span> which among the Ancients were of two Sorts;
some were after the <i>Greek</i>, and some after the <i>Tuscan</i>
Fashion.</p>

<p>The <i>Temples</i> after the <i>Tuscan</i> Fashion were Square,
the <i>Greeks</i> made them sometimes Round, sometimes Square; in
the Square <i>Temples</i> of the <i>Greeks</i>, there are three
Things to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id=
"Page_117">117</a></span> considered, <i>viz.</i> The Parts that
compose it, the Proportion of the <i>Temple</i>, and its
<i>Aspect</i>.</p>

<p>The Parts of the Square <i>Temples</i>, were for the most part
Five; for they had almost every one of them a Porch before the
Temple called <i>Pronaos</i>, and another Porch behind the
<i>Temple</i>, called <i>Posticum</i>, or <i>Opisthedomos</i>, the
middle of the <i>Temple</i>, called <i>Cella</i>, or <i>Sacos</i>;
the <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i> or <i>Isles</i>, and the
<i>Gate</i>.</p>

<p>The Porch was a place covered at the Entrance at the greatest
part of <i>Temples</i>, being as broad as the whole <i>Temple</i>.
There were three sorts of them. Some were surrounded with Pillars
on three Sides; Others had only Pillars in the Front, the Sides of
the Porch being made up by the continuation of the Side-Walls of
the <i>Temple</i>; Others were made up at the Sides, partly by
Pillars, and partly by the Continuation of the Side-Walls of the
<i>Temple</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Posticum</i> of the <i>Temple</i> was equal to the Porch,
having likewise a Gate, but all Temples had not
<i>Posticums</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id=
"Page_118">118</a></span> though almost every <i>Temple</i> had its
<i>Pronaos</i>, or Porch.</p>

<p>The Middle of the <i>Temple</i>, called <i>Cella</i>, was a
place inclosed with four Walls, having no Light but at the Gate,
unless it were uncovered, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>

<p>The <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i> which make the Isles, were ranks of
Pillars, sometimes single, sometimes double, which stood along the
Sides of the <i>Temple</i> on the out-side: some <i>Temples</i>
wanted this part.</p>

<p>The Gates of the <i>Temples</i> were different according to the
difference of the Order of the Architecture, according to which the
<i>Temple</i> was built: there was the <i>Dorick</i>, the
<i>Ionick</i>, and the <i>Attick</i>.</p>

<p>The height of the <i>Dorick</i> Gate was taken by dividing into
3 parts and an half, the space which is from below to the bottom of
the <i>Plat-fond</i> of the <i>Portico</i>, which <i>Platfond</i>
was called <i>Lacunar</i>: they allow'd 2 to the height of the Gate
under the <i>Lintel</i>: this height was divided into 12 parts; 5
and an half were taken for the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> breadth of the Gate below,
for above it was straiter by a 3d. part. A 4th. part, and even an
8th. part of the <i>Chambranle</i> or <i>Door-Case</i>, according
to the height of the Gate, which was to be less straitened above,
the higher it was. The breadth of the <i>Chambranle</i> or
<i>Door-Case</i>, was the 12th. part of the height of the Opening
of the Gate.</p>

<p>The <i>Chambranle</i> or <i>Door-Case</i> grew straiter and
straiter towards the top, <i>viz.</i> the 4th. part of its breadth:
it was only edged with a <i>Cymatium</i>, with an
<i>Astragal</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the <i>Cymatium</i> above the <i>Chambranle</i> or
<i>Door-Case</i>, was a <i>Frise</i> called <i>Hyperthyron</i>,
which had the same breadth with the <i>Chambranle</i> or
<i>Door-Case</i>. Upon this <i>Frise</i> was placed a <i>Dorick
Cymatium</i>, with a <i>Lesbian Astragal</i>; both of them jetting
out very little.</p>

<p>Upon the <i>Moulures</i> the <i>Flat-Crown</i> was placed, with
its little <i>Cymatium</i>, which jetted out the whole breadth
above of the <i>Chambranle</i> or <i>Door-Case</i>, with its
Mould.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id=
"Page_120">120</a></span> The height of the <i>Ionick</i> Gates was
taken as those of the <i>Dorick</i>; but to have the right breadth,
they divided the height into 2 parts and an half: To allow them one
and an half below, it was straitned at the top, as the
<i>Dorick</i> Gate was; the breadth of the <i>Chambranle</i> was
the 14th. part of the height of the Opening of the Gate; this
breadth of the <i>Chambranle</i>, or <i>Door-Case</i>, being
divided into 6, one was allowed for the <i>Cymatium</i>, the rest
being divided into 12, 3 were allowed to the 1st. Face comprising
its <i>Astragal</i>, 4 to the 2d. and 5 to the 3d.</p>

<p>The <i>Frise</i> which is called <i>Hyperthyron</i>, was made
with the same Proportions that are in the <i>Dorick Order</i>. The
<i>Consoles</i> or <i>Shouldering-Pieces</i>, descended directly to
the bottom of the <i>Chambranle</i> or <i>Door-Case</i>, without
comprizing the <i>Foliage</i> or <i>Leaf-work</i> that they had at
the bottom: The breadth above was the 3d. part of that of the
<i>Chambranle</i> or <i>Door-Case</i>, and at the bottom they grew
straiter by a 4th. part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id=
"Page_121">121</a></span>The <i>Attick</i> were like the
<i>Dorick</i>, but their <i>Chambranles</i> or <i>Door-Cases</i>
had only a <i>Plat-band</i> under the <i>Cymatium</i>, and this
<i>Plat-band</i> or <i>Face</i>, had only the breadth of 2 parts in
7, into which was divided all the rest of the <i>Chambranle</i> or
<i>Door-Case</i> with its <i>Mouldings</i>.</p>

<p>The Proportion of the <i>Temples</i> was so ordered, that they
were twice as long as broad, but it is not to be understood
precisely, but only of <i>Temples</i> <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> that were without <i>Pillars</i>, whose
length was divided into 8, and 4 were allowed for the breadth.</p>

<p>The <i>Temples</i> which had <i>Pillars</i> round about, could
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;4.</i><br /><br />
<i>Lib. 3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span>
not have this double Proportion; for as much as the length
had only the double of the
intercolumniations, and by consequence a <i>Pillar</i> less than
the double of the <i>Pillars</i> before and behind.</p>

<p>The <i>Aspect</i> of the <i>Temples</i> signifies two things in
<i>Vitruvius</i>, <i>viz.</i> The Disposition of the parts of the
<i>Temple</i>, in respect of one another, and the Disposition in
respect of the Heavens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id=
"Page_122">122</a></span> As to what regards the Disposition of the
<i>Temple</i> in respect of the Heavens, the Ancients always
observed to turn them toward the Sun-rising, if the place were not
ill-disposed for it, and that some great Street obliged them to
turn it otherwise.</p>

<p>As to what belongs to the Disposition of the parts, <i>viz.</i>
of the <i>Porch</i>, <i>Porticum</i>, <i>Isles</i> or <i>Oiles</i>
within the <i>Temple</i> and the <i>Gates</i>, it was different in
the <i>Temples</i> which were without <i>Pillars</i>, and in those
which had <i>Pillars</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Temples</i> without <i>Pillars</i>, were those that were
not 20 Foot broad, the length of these <i>Temples</i> being divided
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;4.</i></span> into 8, 4 were allowed for the breadth, 5
for the length of the <i>Temple</i> within, and 3 for the
<i>Porch</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Temples</i> which had <i>Pillars</i> were of 8 sorts; The
1st. and the most Simple, was that which was called <i>Ad
Antes</i>, because in this sort of <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
3.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span> <i>Temples</i>, there were only 2
<i>Pillars</i> in the Face or Front before, betwixt 2 <i>Antes</i>.
There was 3 sorts of these <i>Temples</i>.</p>

<p>The First and the most Simple, had<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> 2 <i>Pillars</i> before the
Face of the <i>Temple</i>, at whose Corners there were 2
<i>Antes</i>, and the 2 <i>Pillars</i> supported a <i>Piedement</i>
or <i>Fronton</i>.</p>

<p>The Second Sort had likewise but 2 <i>Pillars</i>, but they were
between 2 <i>Antes</i> upon the same Line with the <i>Antes</i>;
and these <i>Antes</i> with the 2 <i>Pillars</i>, made up the
<i>Face</i> of the <i>Porch</i> of the <i>Temple</i>.</p>

<p>The Third Sort was, when betwixt 2 <i>Pillars</i> which were at
the <i>Face</i> before, which made up the <i>Porch</i>, there were
likewise 2 others within the <i>Porch</i>; these <i>Pillars</i>
within, were not so thick as those without, although they were of
an equal height; but to the end they might seem as thick as those
without, they made more <i>Channellings</i>, for the most part 28
or 32, supposing those without had 24; this was done to get more
room within the <i>Porch</i>. These <i>Temples</i> had also this
particular to themselves, that the Front of the <i>Porch</i> was
closed with Partitions of <i>Marble</i> or
<i>Joyner&rsquo;s-Work</i>, which ran from the <i>Ante</i> of one
of the Corners to its neighbouring <i>Pillar</i>,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span> and from
this <i>Ante</i> to the other <i>Pillar</i>, and from this
<i>Pillar</i> to the other <i>Ante</i>.</p>

<p>The second Sort of <i>Temples</i>, with <i>Pillars</i>, was
called <i>Prostyle</i>; which differ'd not from the first, but in
this, that besides the 2 <i>Pillars</i> of the <i>Temple</i>, <i>Ad
Antes</i>, there were two others directly on the Angular
<i>Antes</i>.</p>

<p>The Third Sort was called <i>Amphiprostyle</i>; because it had
<i>Pillars</i> as well behind as before.</p>

<p>The Fourth Sort was the <i>Periptere</i>, which in the Front, as
well as behind, had 6 <i>Pillars</i>, and 12 on every side,
counting those of the Corners: the distance which was between the
<i>Pillars</i> and the <i>Walls</i>, was equal to that which was
between the <i>Pillars</i>.</p>

<p>The Fifth, the <i>Pseud-diptere</i>, viz. <i>False Diptere</i>,
it had 8 <i>Pillars</i> in the <i>Front</i>, and as many behind,
and 15 on every side, counting those of the Corners: the
<i>Pillars</i> were distant from the Wall, the space of 2
Intercolumniations, and the thickness of a <i>Pillar</i>.</p>

<p>The Sixth Sort was the <i>Diptere</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> which had 8
<i>Pillars</i> before and behind, and 2 rows round about.</p>

<p>The Seventh Sort was called <i>Hypethre</i>, because the inner
part of the <i>Temple</i> was uncovered, it had 10 <i>Pillars</i>
before and behind; and as to the rest, it was like the
<i>Diptere</i>, but in this particular to it self, that all about
it had two Orders of <i>Pillars</i>, at a little distance from the
Wall, to make <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>, as in the
<i>Peristyles</i>.</p>

<p>The Eighth was called <i>Pseudo-Periptere</i>, or <i>False
Periptere</i>; for the Disposition of the <i>Pillars</i> was equal
to that of the <i>Pillars</i> of the <i>Periptere</i>: This
<i>Temple</i> having 6 <i>Pillars</i> in the <i>Front</i>, and
behind, and 11 in the <i>Isles</i> or <i>Wings</i>; but the
Disposition of the Walls of the <i>Temple</i> was different in
this, that they extended even to the <i>Pillars</i>, which made no
<i>Portico</i>, for they were joyned to the Walls, except those of
the <i>Porch</i> which were insulated, or stood alone like
Islands.</p>

<p>The Round <i>Temples</i> were of 2 sorts; The first were called
<i>Monopteres</i>, because they had no Walls, having only an
<i>Isle</i> or <i>Wing</i>; viz. <i>Pillars</i> which<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span> supported
a <i>Coupe</i>. Their Proportion was, that dividing the whole
<i>Temple</i> into three, one part was allowed for the <i>Steps</i>
upon which the <i>Pillars</i> were placed, which had their height
equal to the distance that there was from one <i>Pillar</i>, to
that which was Diametrically opposite to it.</p>

<p>The Second Sort which was called <i>Periptere</i>, had
<i>Pillars</i> upon their <i>Basis</i> round about the
<i>Temple</i>, the space that was between the <i>Basis</i> and the
<i>Wall</i> was the 5th. part of the whole <i>Temple</i>, and the
Diameter of the <i>Temple</i> within, was equal to the height of
the <i>Pillar</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Temples</i> after the <i>Tuscan</i> fashion were square,
having 5 parts in length and 4 in breadth; the <i>Porch</i> which
was as great as the rest of the <i>Temple</i>, had 4 <i>Pillars</i>
in the <i>Front</i>; the Sides were closed half by the Continuation
of the Walls of the <i>Temple</i>, half by 2 <i>Angular
Pillars</i>; and there were likewise 2 <i>Pillars</i> in the middle
of the <i>Porch</i>: The <i>Temple</i> had 2 <i>Chappels</i> within
on each Side.</p>

<p>We find that the Ancients had 14<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> Sorts of <i>Temples</i>,
viz. 1. The Temple without <i>Pillars</i>. 2. The Temple <i>ad
antes</i> Simply. 3. The Temple <i>ad Antes</i>, with 2
<i>Pillars</i> upon the same Line with the <i>Antes</i>. 4. The
Temple <i>ad antes</i>, with <i>Pillars</i> of an unequal
Magnitude. 5. The <i>Prostyle</i>. 6. The <i>Amphiprostyle</i>. 7.
The <i>Periptere</i>. 8. The <i>Pseudo-diptere</i>. 9. The
<i>Diptere</i>. 10. The <i>Hypethre</i>. 11. The

<div class="center"><i>Of Publick Places</i>, Basilica&rsquo;s,
Theatres, Gates, Baths <i>and</i> Academies.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
Third Sort of <i>Publick Fabricks</i> are those which are Built for
the Convenience and Use of all <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;1.</i></span> People; and there are Six Sorts of them,
viz. <i>Market-Places</i>, <i>Basilica&rsquo;s</i>,
<i>Theatres</i>, <i>Gates</i>, <i>Baths</i> and
<i>Academies</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id=
"Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Market-Places</i> among the <i>Greeks</i> were surrounded
with Pillars close one against another. Among the <i>Romans</i>,
the Pillars which environed the <i>Market-Places</i>, had larger
Intercolumniations, for they made <i>Peristyles</i>, under which
were Shops.</p>

<p>The Proportion of the <i>Market-Places</i> was so ordered, that
having divided the length into three parts, they allowed two for
the breadth; the <i>Basilica&rsquo;s</i> had never less breadth
than the third part of their length, nor more than the half.</p>

<p>The Pillars were as high as the Isles or Wings were broad, and
these Isles or Wings had a third part of the great Vault in the
middle.</p>

<p>There was likewise a Second rank of Pillars upon the Wings,
which made high Galleries, and these Second rank of Pillars were
placed upon a <i>Pedestal</i> in the form of a Partition, high
enough to hinder those that were in the high Galleries from being
seen by those that were below.</p>

<p>At the End of every <i>Basilica</i>, there was a high and great
Hall called <i>Chalcidiques</i><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>, which were joyned one to
another by high Galleries: they served the Spectators while Justice
was distributed.</p>

<p>The <i>Theaters</i> were composed of three parts, <i>viz.</i>
The Steps or Degrees, which were instead of Seats for the
Spectators: they were disposed in a Semi-circle, and they closed a
void space in the middle and at the bottom of the whole
<i>Theater</i>, which was called the <i>Orchestra</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Orchestra</i> was made in the <i>Gr&aelig;cian
Theatre</i>, to Dance the Ballets. <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span> The Senators were placed in that of the
<i>Romans</i>, because the Ballets were Danced upon the Scene.</p>

<p>Above and quite round the Steps <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.
5.<br />Chap.&nbsp;6.</i><br /><br /><i>Lib. 5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span> or Degrees was a <i>Portico</i> of
Pillars, the Steps being separated by divers <i>Palliers</i> or
Landing and Resting places which went round, and by streight passages which went ascending from one
<i>Palliere</i> or Landing place to another; so that the ways which
led from the second <i>Palliere</i> to the third, parted betwixt
those of the first, and ended betwixt those of the third.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span> The
Steps or Degrees were 14 or 15 Inches high, and from 28 to 30
broad.</p>

<p>Under the Degrees, above every <i>Palliere</i>, there were in
the great <i>Theaters</i> 13 <i>Chambers</i>, in which were Vessels
of Brass, set to several Tunes, or Tones; which by their Echo
augmented the Voice of the Players. The Scene or Stage, was
composed of the <i>Pulpit</i>, the <i>Proscenium</i> and the
<i>Parascenium</i>. The <i>Pulpit</i> was the place where the
Actors played: it was raised not above five Foot at the most above
the <i>Orchestra</i>, or <i>Pit</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Proscenium</i> was the Front of the Stage, which was
adorned with Pillars of several sorts one above another. These
Orders were so proportioned, that the second was a fourth part
lesser than the first. The third diminishing according to the same
Proportion.</p>

<p>The Front had three Gates, that in the middle which was the
greatest was called the <i>Royal Gate</i>, the two others were
called the <i>Gates of Strangers</i>.</p>

<p>These three Gates were closed<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> with Machines, made in a
Triangle, and composed of three Fronts or Faces well Painted, to
represent Buildings <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.</i></span> in
Perspective; they served for the changing of the Scenes, when these
Machines were turned. And the Paintings represented three sorts of
Buildings, which made three sorts of Scenes, <i>viz.</i> The
<i>Tragick</i> by <i>Magnificent Pallaces</i>, the <i>Comick</i> by
<i>Private Houses</i>, the <i>Satyrical</i> (<i>i. e.</i> the
<i>Pastoral</i>) by <i>Fields</i> and <i>Groves</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Parascenium</i> or <i>Postscenium</i> was the hinder part
of the <i>Theater</i>, and the place whither the Actors retired and
dressed themselves, and had their Rehearsals, and where the
Machines were kept. Near the <i>Theaters</i>, were Publick Walks,
in length a <i>Stadium</i>, which is about 90 <i>Perches</i>. There
were Trees planted, and round about it were double <i>Porticos</i>,
which were every one as broad as the Pillars on the out-side were
high; for those within were higher by a fifth part, than those
without, and they were likewise of a different <i>Order</i>; for
those without were of the <i>Dorick Order</i>,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span> and those
within of the <i>Ionick</i> or <i>Corinthian</i>.</p>

<p>The Ancients built their <i>Ports</i> in two manners; at those
which were <i>Natural</i>, they only made <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>
round <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;13.</i></span> about with <i>Magazines</i> and
<i>Towers</i> at the Ends, for to shut the <i>Port</i> with a
Chain.</p>

<p>Those which were <i>Artificial</i>, were built three several
ways: The first was to make Partitions of Wood only, without
emptying the Water which was within the Partitions, and they cast
into the Partitions, Stone and Mortar made with <i>Pozzolana</i>,
thrown in hand over head; for they were certain that this Mortar
wou'd grow dry in the bottom of the Water. The second Way was by
making Partitions with ordinary Clay, or fat Earth at the bottom of
the Sea, after the Water had been emptied out by Pumps. The third
Way was to build a Mole upon the Sea-Coast, and to cast it in when
the <i>Mason&rsquo;s</i> Work was sufficiently dry, which only
required two Months time. That they might the better throw these
Moles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
"Page_133">133</a></span> into the Sea, they built them half upon
the Sea-Coast, and half upon an heap of Sand which they made close
to the Sea-Coast; to the end, that this Sand which was stopped by
nothing but by the Walls, built only to support it during the time
that the Mole was a drying, might let it fall when the Sea came to
carry away the Sand after that the Walls were beaten down.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 5.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;10.</i></span> The <i>Bathes</i> of the Ancients
consisted of many Chambers; some for Men, and some for Women.</p>

<p>Some of the Chambers had a moderate Heat, to warm their Bodies
insensibly, and prepare them for a stronger Heat to make them
Sweat.</p>

<p>The Chamber they were to Sweat in, was called <i>Laconicum</i>,
and was round, and Vaulted like the ends of an Oven, pierced at the
top with a round Opening, which was opened and shut with a Buckler
of Brass, which hung at a Chain, by which means they augmented or
diminished the Heat according to the Pro<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>portion that they
pull'd up, or let down the Buckler.</p>

<p>One and the same Furnace heated both the Air and the Water,
according to the Disposition of the places which were nearer or
further from the Furnace, whose heat was communicated to the
Chambers from under the Flooring, which was made full of little
holes.</p>

<p>The Water was likewise diversly tempered by the different
situation of three great Vessels of Brass, whose Water went from
one into another, and there were Pipes that conveyed these three
sorts of Water into the <i>Bath</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Academies</i> of the Ancients, which they called
<i>Pal&aelig;stra</i>, was a place where the Youth learned Letters
and their Exercises. They were composed of three parts, <i>viz.</i>
Of a <i>Peristyle</i>, a <i>Xyste</i>, and a <i>Stadium</i>; the
<i>Peristyle</i> was a Court surrounded with
<i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>, which were of two sorts; three of them were
Simple, and one Double.</p>

<p>The Simple stood in a row against<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span> three Bodies of Lodgings,
composed of many great Halls, where the Philosophers had their
Disputes and Conferences.</p>

<p>The Bodies of the Lodgings, which was the length of the double
<i>Portico</i>, and one part of the Bodies of Lodgings which turned
in, were distributed into several parts, for the Studies and
Exercises of Youth; for there they had their <i>Classes</i>, their
<i>Baths</i>, their <i>Stoves</i>, and their
<i>Tenis-Court</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Xyste</i> was a place planted with Trees, and surrounded
with <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i> on every side: These
<i>Portico&rsquo;s</i> were of two sorts.</p>

<p>There was one double which was set against the Bodies of the
Lodgings, to which the double <i>Portico</i> of the
<i>Peristyle</i> was joyned.</p>

<p>The <i>Simple Portico&rsquo;s</i> had two Wings, under these
<i>Simple Portico&rsquo;s</i> there were hollow Ways, where they
performed their Exercises; the rest of the <i>Portico</i> was
raised to the right and the left, for those that had a mind to Walk
while the rest performed their Exercises, in the hollow ways.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id=
"Page_136">136</a></span>The Place which was compassed with these
three <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>, was planted with Trees, which made
Allies, where the Wrestlers exercised in Winter, when it was fair
Weather.</p>

<p>The <i>Stadium</i> was on the Side of the <i>Peristyle</i> and
the <i>Xyste</i>. It was an Alley of 90 Perches; on each Side it
had many Steps or Degrees, which made a sort of a long
<i>Theater</i> bending in at both ends; these Steps or Degrees were
made for the convenience of seeing them that Run.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of the Courts of Houses.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft" alt="T" />HE
Houses of the Ancients had five sorts of Courts, of which the
greatest part were covered round about by the Jettings which
supported the Water-Channel <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;3.</i></span> or Gutter, in which all the Water that
fell from the Roof met together.</p>

<p>These Courts made with Jettings, were of four sorts; The first
was called the <i>Tuscan</i>, this Court was surrounded with a
Jetting <i>en auvent</i>, which was laid upon four Beams, supported
by other standing Beams placed in the Corners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id=
"Page_138">138</a></span>The second Sort was called
<i>Corinthian</i>; it had likewise Beams, but they were further
from the Walls than in the <i>Tuscan</i> Court, and they were laid
upon Pillars.</p>

<p>The third Sort was called <i>Tetrastyle</i>, because the Beams
were supported with four Pillars which were in the place of the
standing Beams that were made use of in the <i>Tuscan
Court</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth Sort was called the <i>Vaulted</i>; because the
Jetting that it had round about, was supported by Vaults.</p>

<p>The fifth Sort of <i>Court</i> that had no Jetting, and which
was called the <i>Uncovered</i>, had the <i>Water-Gutter</i>
directly upon the Wall, and was only covered with the
Entablature.</p>

<h3>ART. II.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of the</i> Vestibulum <i>or</i> Entry.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
Houses of the Ancients had <i>Great</i> and <i>Magnificent
Entries</i>, they were sometimes 15 Perches long and 9 broad, and
they were supported upon two ranks of Pillars, which made a Wing on
each Side, the Proportion of their breadth and length was taken
three Ways. The first was, when having divided the length into 5, 3
were allowed for the breadth. The second was, when having divided
it into 3, 2 were allowed for the breadth. The third was, when
having made an Equilateral Square, the Diagonal of this Square was
taken for the length, and the Side for the breadth.</p>

<p>The height was equal to the length, taken from the Pavement
below, to the bottom of the <i>Plat-Fonds</i> or <i>Flat-Roof</i>,
which was hollowed on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140"
id="Page_140">140</a></span> other side the Beams, the seventh part
of the whole height.</p>

<p>The Proportion that the <i>Alley</i> which was in the middle
between the Pillars, had with the Wings, was different according to
the Magnitude of the <i>Vestibule</i> or <i>Entry</i>, for the
greater they were or the lesser, the Wings had a proportionable
breadth with the <i>Alley</i> in the middle; So that if the
<i>Vestibule</i> or <i>Entry</i> was 100 Foot long, the Wings had
only for their breadth the 50th. part of the length; and when it
was but 30 Foot long, they had only the 3d. part.</p>

<h3>ART. III.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of</i> Halls.</div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE
Ancients had three Sorts of <i>Halls</i>; <i>Viz.</i> The
<i>Corinthian</i>, the <i>&AElig;gyptian</i>, and the
<i>Cyzican</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id=
"Page_141">141</a></span>The <i>Corinthian</i> had Pillars round
about against the Wall, and these Pillars supported the Floor made
in form of a Vault. <i>Surbaissee</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>&AElig;gyptian Halls</i> had their Pillars distant from
the Wall in the manner of the <i>Peristyle</i>, and they supported
only an <i>Architrave</i> without a <i>Frise</i> and without a
<i>Cornice</i>; upon this <i>Architrave</i> there was another row
of Pillars, between which were the Windows. The Floor which reached
from the Pillars to the Wall, served for a <i>Terrasse</i>
without.</p>

<p>The <i>Cyzican Halls</i> had this in particular, that they were
turned to the North, and had a Prospect of the Gardens; they were
principally made <span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 6.<br />

Proportion of these <i>Halls</i> was as follows, Their length was
double their breadth, and as to their height, this Rule was
observed to have the height of all Sorts of Apartments that are not
so broad as long, they added their length to their breadth, and
took half of the sum for their height. The Apartments which were no
longer than broad, had in height their breadth, and half their
breadth.</p>

Order to the bringing of Waters to Towns and Cities, the Level must
be exactly taken; to the end, it may be known whether the Waters
can be brought thither or no. The Ancients to this end made <span
class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 8<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span> use of an Instrument called
<i>Corobates</i>, which was directed by a Lead, and by Water, when
the Wind hindered them from making use of the Lead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
"Page_144">144</a></span>They brought their Water three several
ways; <i>viz.</i> by <i>Aqueducts</i>, by Pipes of Lead, and Pipes
baked in a <i>Potter&rsquo;s</i> Furnace. They allowed for the
<i>Channels</i> or <i>Sewers</i> of the <i>Aqueducts</i>, for every
100 Foot, half a Foot of Declination or Sloping; and if any Hills
were in their way, they dug through them, making Vents to give Air
at convenient Distances.</p>

<p>The Pipes of Lead were at least 9 Foot long; they made them of
bended Sheets or Plates, and of different thicknesses, according to
the Proportion of the greatness of the Pipes; these Pipes had
likewise their necessary Declination or Sloping, and if any Valley
was in the way, they made it equal to the Level with a Wall; they
likewise made many Vents, to give the Water Air, and to know where
to mend the Pipes.</p>

<p>The Pipes of <i>Potter&rsquo;s-Work</i>, were two Inches thick;
they were joyned together with Mortar mixed with Oil, and when they
had <i>Conde</i> or <i>Joynt</i> to make, they made use of a red
Free Stone which they pierced<span class='pagenum'><a name=

being remarkt oftentimes that the Water which is under the Earth
hath many bad Qualities, and exhales vapours, which often stifles
those which work in the <i>Wells</i>, after that they are dug,
&amp; the Water begins to gather together. The Ancients had this
Precaution, to let a Lamp gently down into it, and if it
extinguished it, they took it for an Infallible sign that the Water
was bad.</p>

<p>The <i>Cisterns</i> were made to receive Rain Water in great
Conservatories under Ground, whose Walls on all Sides, and at the
bottom were built with Mortar of strong Lime, and Sand, and
Pebbles, all well beaten together. They made several
Conservatories, and the Water passed from one to ano<span class=

the end it might leave all the Dirt in the first and second; They

<div class="center"><i>Of</i> Machines <i>for carrying and lifting

<p><img src="images/capital_c.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=
"C" /><i>Tesiphon</i> and his Son <i>Metagenes</i>, Architects of
the Temple of <i>Ephesus</i>, invented <i>Machines</i> to carry
<i>great Stones</i>, out of which <i>Pillars</i> and
<i>Architraves</i> were to be made. That <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;6.</i></span> which was made to draw the <i>Pillars</i>,
was but a sort of a Frame as long as the <i>Pillars</i>, in the end
of which were fastned Pins of Iron, which entred into the ends of
the Frame, and served instead of an Axle-tree, the <i>Pillar</i> it
self serving for a Wheel: And this had the desired Effect, because
of the disposition of the place through which these <i>Stones</i>
were to be drawn, which was a flat and level Country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id=
"Page_147">147</a></span>The other <i>Machine</i> for drawing of
<i>Architraves</i>, was the same Frame which had two Wheels at each
end, which supported the <i>Architrave</i>; which served instead of
an Axle-tree.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> For the raising of great Weights, they had
three sorts of <i>Machines</i>. The first was composed of three
pieces of Wood, which were joyned together at top by a Pin which
went through them all; so that there were two of these pieces which
were on one side, a little distance one from the other, and the
third was opposite to them; The two which were together on the one
side, had a Hand-Mill which drew a Rope, which passed within a
Truckle with three Pullies, of which that part which had the two
Pullies was fastned to the top of the <i>Machine</i>, and that
which had but one, was fastned to the VVeight to be drawn up.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> The second <i>Machine</i> was stronger
than the first, because the <i>Moulin</i> had more Pullies, and
instead of a <i>Moulin</i> or Hand-Mill, it had a great Wheel,
whose Axle-tree drew a Rope which passed through these Pullies, and
upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id=
"Page_148">148</a></span> the Wheel there was another Rope twisted,
which was drawn by a Wind-glass; sometimes the great Wheel was
hollow, so that Men could walk within it, and so turn it.</p>

<p>The third had but one long and strong piece of Wood, which was
kept up and stayed by Shrowds, as the Mast of a Ship is. By the
help of these Shrowds, they bended and turned this piece of Wood
where they pleased, drawing the Shrowds fast on the one side, and
loosening them on the other. The <i>Moufl&rsquo;s</i> Crane as well
those which were fastned to this piece of Wood, as those which were
fastned to the Weight which was to be drawn up, had each of them
three ranks of Pullies, which had three in every rank, that three
Ropes might go through them, which were not drawn by Hand-Mills,
nor by VVheels, but by Men who pulled several at one time at the
same Rope: And that this might be done with the more ease, the
three Ropes or Cables after having passed the last Pullies of that
part of the <i>Moufle</i> which was at<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span> the top of the
<i>Machine</i>; they descended down below, each upon one Pully,
which vvas but the height of the Men: this <i>Machine</i> quickly
povverfully lifted up the greatest VVeights.</p>

<h3>ART. IV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of</i> Machines <i>for Elevating of
Waters.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft4" alt=
"T" />HESE <i>Machines</i> were of four sorts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.</i></span> The first was the
<i>Tympan</i>, of which there were two sorts; The first elevated a
great deal of Water, but not very high, for it only mounted to the
Axle-tree of the <i>Tympan</i>, which was a great Wheel made of
Planks which made two bottoms divided into eight from the Center to
the Circumference, each Separation, having an opening half a Foot
wide near the Circumference to draw the Water, which being elevated
upon the Axle-tree, ran through the Cavities which<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span> were
hollowed in each Separation.</p>

<p>The Second <i>Machine</i>, was a Wheel which elevated the Water
as high as its Circumference, by the help of several Boxes which
were fastned round about, and which poured out the Water into a
Reeve as the Wheel, having mounted, began to descend.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> The Third <i>Machine</i> was a Chain with
Buckets, as the one mounted, the other descended, being drawn by
the Axle-tree.</p>

<p>The Fourth <i>Machine</i> was the Vice or <i>Skrew</i>, which is
attributed to <i>Archimedes</i>, though <i>Vitruvius</i> makes no
mention of the Inventor. This Vice was made of a piece of VVood,
long sixteen times its Diameter: about this piece of Wood was put
Obliquely a Hoop of Willow Hoop of Willow VVood besmeared with
Pitch, and it was Conducted by turning from one end of the piece of
the Wood to the other: Upon this Hoop others were put so that they
were like the Vaulting of a Stair-Case whose ascent goes turning.
This being done, this Vice was fastned and strengthned with Planks,
which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
"Page_151">151</a></span> pitched within, and covered with Iron
Rings and Plates without: At the two ends of the piece of Wood,
were Pins, which entring into the Suckets, made the <i>Machine</i>
capable of Motion. This Vice or Skrew was placed according to the
bent or sloping of the Triangle Rectangle of <i>Pythagoras</i>.
This <i>Machine</i> elevated easily a great quantity of Water, but
it could not carry it high.</p>

<p>The Fifth <i>Machine</i>, was the Pump <span class=
"sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;2.</i></span> of <i>Ctesibius</i>; it was composed of
two Bodies of Pumps, in which the Suckets having drawn the VVater
when they were pulled up, they both pressed it violently into a
Pipe which was fastned at the bottom of the Body of the Pump when
they went down. For the VVater by the Impulsion of the Sucket, was
forced to enter into these Pipes, because it could not go out by
the Openings by which it entred, because of the Suckets which
stopped them, these two Pipes were joyned together in a
<i>Tambour</i>, which had likewise its Suckets, which hindred the
VVater from descending in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152"
id="Page_152">152</a></span>to the Bodies of the Pumps, after it
had been pressed into the <i>Tambour</i>, or <i>Vase</i>, which had
another Pipe, through which the VVater was forced as high as they
pleased, by Impulsion of the Suckets.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;10.</i></span> All these <i>Machines</i> were either
<i>moved</i> by Strength of Men, or by VVater-Mills, according to
the convenience of the place.</p>

a great VVheel which had many VVings, which were forced by the
Current. The Axle-tree of this great VVheel, traversed another
VVheel which had Cogs, which made the <i>Lanterne</i> or
<i>Trundle-head</i> go, which was placed Horizontally, which was
traversed by a Beam of Iron, which entred through above, into an
Iron in form of a VVedge, which helped to fasten the Beam in the
Mill-stone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id=

<h3>ART. VI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Of other Hydraulick Machines.</i></div>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class="floatLeft2" alt=

of the VVater, as <i>Hour-Glasses</i>, <i>Organs</i>,
<i>Machines</i> for Measuring the VVays, and knowing the swiftness
or slowness of Sailing.</p>

<p>The <i>Hour-Glasses</i> marked the Hours by the help of VVater,
which passing slowly, a little hole made at the bottom of a Vessel,
and falling into another, in elevating it self insensibly in the
Vessel which it filled, raised a piece of Cork, which hanging at
one of the ends of a Chain wrapped about an Axle-tree, and which
had at the other end a little Bag full of Sand, and a little
lighter than the Cork: for this Chain turning, the Axle-tree
likewise turned a Pin or Hand, which marked the Hours upon a
Dial.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;12.</i></span> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154">154</a></span>The <i>Organs</i> played by help of two
Suckets, which were pulled up or let down in the Bodies of the
Pump. The Suckets pushed the Air with violence into a Funnel
reversed in a Copper Coffer half full of VVater, and pressed the
Water, and constrained it to ascend round about within the Coffer,
which made that its weight in making it re-enter into the Funnel,
pushed the Air into the Pipes, and made them Play, producing the
same Effects that the Bellows did.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;14.</i></span> They measured the way that the Ships make
by the help of a little Mill, which was fastned to the Ship, and
which turned by the resistance that its VVings found in the VVater
when the Ship went forward and the Axle-tree of this Mill had a
little Rong or Tooth, which every round pushed forwards one of the
Teeth of the great VVheel, which turned another, and that another
which turned a Pin or Handle, which marked the number of turnings,
that the Mill made, by which means it was easie to take an account
of the Perches, and Leagues that the Ship sailed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id=
"Page_155">155</a></span>They made use of the same <i>Machine</i>
on the Land, fixing to the Nave of the VVheel of a Coach, a Tooth
which made many VVheels be turned as in the above-mentioned
<i>Machine</i>, at the last of which, was fastned a Pin or Handle,
which marked the number of Perches and Leagues. This <i>Machine</i>
had likewise a sort of a Counting VVheel, which at every Mile that
the Coach went, let a Pibble fall into a Vessel of Brass, to give
notice that they had gone a Mile.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Of Machines of War</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;15.</i></span> <img src="images/capital_t.png" class=
"floatLeft2" alt="T" />HE <i>Machines</i> of VVar of the Ancients
were of three Sorts, for they were made either to Lance, Arrows,
such as were the <i>Scorpions</i> or <i>Javelins</i>, such as were
the <i>Catapulta&rsquo;s</i>, or Stones, such as were
<i>Ballista&rsquo;s</i> or fiery Darts, such as were the
<i>Pyroboli</i>, or they were made to beat down the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span> VValls,
such as were the battering Rams, and the <i>Terebra</i>, or to come
covered to the VValls, and so safely Mount the Ramparts, such as
were the <i>Tortoises</i> or <i>Testudo&rsquo;s</i>, and the Towers
of VVood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;18.</i></span> The <i>Scorpions</i> were a sort of great
Crossbows, which were made use of to defend the VValls, and which
likewise the Assailants made use of in the wooden Towers, to annoy
those that defended the VValls.</p>

<p>The <i>Catapulta</i>, lanced Javelins or Javelots, from 12 to 15
Foot in length, they were made of two Trees, set one against
another, like the Masts of a Ship, which were bended in drawing
them with a Hand-Mill. These Trees being on a suddain unbent,
furiously struck together, and forced violently the Javelin. They
were bent the one after the other by the same Cord, which was made
of Guts, to the end, that the Master who managed the Engine, might
be assured, that the two Trees or Beams were equally bent. He knew
it by sounding the Cord when both the Beams<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span> were bent, and when
the End above was drawn even to the Capital of the <i>Machine</i>,
where they were stayed by a Pin of Iron, which was driven out by a
quick stroke of a Hammer when they unbent it. There was a Cylinder
which traversed an excentrical piece, by the help of which they
heightned, or let down the End of one of the Beams below, according
as the Master of the <i>Machine</i> judged it necessary, for the
augmenting or diminishing their bent, which was known by the sound
of the Cord, which was alike in both, when they were equally bent.
See <a href="#p_11">Table XI.</a></p>

<p>The <i>Ballista&rsquo;s</i> were bended and strung as the
<i>Catapulta&rsquo;s</i>, but instead of Javelins, they cast great
Stones.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib.</i> 10.<br />
<i>Chap.</i> 22.</span> The <i>Pyroboli</i> were <i>Machines</i>,
which lanced or cast Darts, to vvhich vvas fixed combustible
Matter, vvhich was kindled vvhen they darted it against

Walls.</p>

<p>The <i>Terebra</i> vvas something like the Ram, being a strong
Beam pointed vvith Iron, but it vvas sharp pointed, and it made
vvay for the Ram, splitting the Stones.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 10.<br />
Chap.&nbsp;20.</i></span> The <i>Testudo</i> or <i>Tortoise</i>,
vvere great large and low Towers of Wood, which were rowled upon
six or eight Wheels, they were covered with raw Hides to defend
them from fire. Their use was to cover them that approached the
Walls to undermine them, or beat them with the battering Ram.</p>

<p>The Towers of Wood were made to raise the Assailants as high as
the Walls, to chace the Besieged away with Arrows and Scorpions,
and to lay Bridges from the Towers to the Wall; they were sometimes
Thirty Fathoms high, having Twenty Stages. They were covered, as
the <i>Tortoises</i> with raw Hides; they had each of them a
Hundred Men, which were employed as well to move them, as to annoy
the Besieged.</p>

<p>This contains the Proportions of the Ionick Capital, of which
only half is seen here: A B is the half of the breadth of the
Abacus, which is regulated according to the breadth of the bottom
of the Column, of which one half is marked B 18; for the bottom of
the Column being divided into 18, 19 are allowed to the Abacus: A C
is the <i>Retreat</i> which must be made of the Corner A, of the
Abacus inwardly, to draw the Line C D, which must regulate the
<i>Eye</i> of the <i>Volute</i> over which it must cross as it
passes. To make this <i>Retreat</i> we must take one part and a
half of twelve, into which is divided the height or thickness, E F,
of the whole Capital, which height is equal to half the breadth of
the Abacus. This height, marked C D, is divided into nine parts and
a half, of which one and a half is given to the <i>Abacus</i>, and
four and a half from the Abacus to the middle of the <i>Eye</i>,
which is traversed by the line G H; the Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, mark
the four Centers of the first four quarters of the Volute; the four
second quarters, and the four third (for the Volutte has twelve)

Capital, which has for its height only the Diameter of the bottom
of the Column; B is the Capital of the Pantheon, which is higher by
a seventh part, <i>viz.</i> the thickness of the Abacus; C D is the
height of the Capital divided into seven, of which the Abacus has
one, the Voluta&rsquo;s and Foliages and Stalks two, the Foliage in
the Range above two, and that in the Range below two. To have the
breadth of the Abacus, we must give to its Diagonal E F the double
of its height C D. To have the greatness and just Proportion of its
bending H, we must divide the breadth of the Abacus E G into nine
parts, and give it one.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this Table is represented the Herb

<h3><i>Explication of the Hardest Terms in</i> Architecture.<br />
<br />
</h3>

<h4>A</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_a.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="A" /> <i>Bacus</i>, from
&#7940;&beta;&alpha;&xi;; which signifies a square Trencher: In
French it&rsquo;s called <i>Talloir</i>; it&rsquo;s that
quadrangular Piece commonly accompanied with a <i>Cymatium</i>, and
serves instead of a <i>Drip</i> or <i>Corona</i> to the Capital. It
supports the nether <i>Face</i> of the <i>Architrave</i> and whole
<i>Trabeation</i>. In the <i>Corinthian</i> and the <i>Compound</i>
Orders, its Corners are called the <i>Horns</i>, the intermediate
<i>Sweep</i> and <i>Curvature</i>; the Arch, which has commonly a
<i>Rose</i> carved in the middle.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Acroteria</i> or <i>Acroter&rsquo;s</i> from
&#7936;&kappa;&rho;&#8057;&nu;, <i>Summa pars</i>; they may be
properly called <i>Pinnacles</i>, for <i>Pins</i> and
<i>Battlements</i> were made sometimes more towring; but when they
stood in <i>Ranges</i> with <i>Rails</i> and <i>Balisters</i>: Upon
flat Building they still retained their Name, with this only
difference, that such as were placed between the <i>Angular</i>
Points, were stiled the <i>Median</i>, or middle
<i>Acroteria</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Annulets</i>, are little square Parts turned
round in the <i>Corinthian Capital</i>, under the
<i>Quarter-Round</i>, called <i>Echinus</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Ante</i>, is a square Pillaster, which the
Ancients placed at the corners of the Walls of the Temples.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Amphiprostyle</i> from
&alpha;&mu;&phi;&#8054;, <i>Circa</i>, and
&sigma;&tau;&#8059;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;; <i>Columna</i> was a
sort of a Temple which had four Columns in the Front of the Temple,
and four in the Face behind.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Architrave</i>, from a Mungril Compound of
two Languages, &alpha;&rho;&chi;&eta; <i>Principalis</i>, and
<i>Trabs</i>; it&rsquo;s the first Member of that which we call
<i>Entablature</i>; in Chimnies the <i>Architrave</i> is the
<i>mantle</i>; over the <i>Jambs</i> of the Doors and Lintels of
Windows, it&rsquo;s called the <i>Hyperthron</i>, from the Greek
&#8017;&pi;&#8050;&rho;, <i>super</i> and
&theta;&#8017;&rho;&alpha;, <i>Janua</i> or <i>Ostium</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Astragal</i>, from the Greek word
&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&#8049;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;
which signifies the <i>Vertebr&aelig;</i>, or little Joints in the
Neck or Heel; hence the French call it <i>Talon</i>, or the Heel
itself: It&rsquo;s a Member of <i>Architecture</i> joyned to
<i>Bases</i>, <i>Cornices</i>, <i>Architraves</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
it&rsquo;s round like a Ring, and therefore it&rsquo;s called by
the Italians <i>Tondino</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Attiq;</i> signifies after the manner of the
City of <i>Athens</i>. In <i>Vitruvius</i> it&rsquo;s the Name of
the <i>Basis</i> which the Moderns have given to the <i>Dorick</i>
Pillar. We call <i>Attiq;</i> in our Buildings, a little Order
placed upon another much greater; for instead of Pillars, this
little Order has commonly nothing but Pillasters of a particular
Fashion and Order, which we call <i>Attiq;</i></p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Apophyges</i>, vide <i>Cong&eacute;</i>.</p>

<h4>B</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_b.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="B" /><i>Asilica</i>, from the Greek word
&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf;
<i>Rex</i> or King among the Ancients. It was a great Hall which
had two Ranges of Pillars, and had two Isles or Wings, upon which
were Galleries: These Halls, which at first were made for the
Palaces of Kings, were afterwards turned into Courts of Justice,
and after that into Churches; which Form has always been
observed.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Ballustre</i> is the lateral part of the
<i>Jonick</i> Capital. Our Workmen have given it that name, because
it somewhat resembles a <i>Balluster</i>.</p>

<h4>C</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_c.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="C" /><i>Hanel</i>, in the <i>Ionick</i> Capital,
is that part which is under the <i>Abacus</i>, and lies upon
<i>Echinus</i> or Egg, and which has its <i>Contours</i> or
Turnings on every side to make the Voluta&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Cariatides</i> are Statues of Women, which
serve instead of Pillars.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Cincture</i> is that part which makes the
middle of the <i>Ballustre</i> of the <i>Ionick Voluta</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Cong&eacute;</i> in French, in Latin
<i>Apophyges</i>, from the Greek word
&alpha;&pi;&omicron;&phi;&upsilon;&gamma;&#8053; because that part
of the Pillar taking as it were a rise, seems to emerge and fly
from the <i>Basis</i> like the <i>Proceltus</i> of a Bone in a mans
Leg, In short, it&rsquo;s no more than the <i>Rings</i> or
<i>Ferils</i> heretofore used at the Extremities of wooden Pillars,
to preserve them from splitting, afterwards imitated in
Stone-work.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Corona</i> is properly that part of the
Cornice which the French call <i>Larmer</i> or <i>Drip</i>, because
it defends the rest of the Work from Wind and Weather: It is often
taken by <i>Vitruvius</i> for all the Cornice.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Corona</i>, called the <i>Plat</i> or
<i>flat Crown</i>, is a particular Member in the <i>Dorick</i>
Gate; it&rsquo;s made by so extraordinary enlargement of the
<i>Face</i> of the <i>Corona</i> or <i>Drip</i>, that it has six
times more Breadth than Projecture. This sort of <i>Corona</i> is
no where found among the Ancients, but only in the Writings of
<i>Vitruvius</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Cymatium</i>, from
&kappa;&upsilon;&mu;&#8049;&tau;&omicron;&nu;, which signifies a
rouling <i>Wave</i>; is a Member of Architecture, of which the one
half is <i>Convex</i> and the other <i>Concave</i>, the one being
hollow above, and the other below. There are two sorts of them, the
one called the <i>Gola</i> or <i>Throats</i>, or the
<i>Doucine</i>, whose advanced part is <i>Concave</i>; and the
other is called by the French the <i>Talon</i> or Heel, whose
advanced part is hollow below, as the first is above.</p>

<h4>D</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_d.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="D" /><i>IE</i> is the middle of the Pedestals,
<i>viz.</i> that which is between their <i>Basis</i> and their
<i>Cornice</i>. It&rsquo;s so called, because it&rsquo;s for the
most part of a Cubit form, as <i>Die&rsquo;s</i> are that are used
in play.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Dentils</i>, or Teeth, is a Member of the
<i>Jonick</i> Cornice, which is square, and cut out at convenient
distances, which gives it the form of a Set or Gang of Teeth.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Diastyle</i>, from &delta;&iota;&#8048; and
&sigma;&tau;&#8059;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;: <i>Columna</i> is a
sort of Edifice where the Pillars are distanced one from another
the breadth of 3 Diameters of the Pillar.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Diptere</i>, from &delta;&#8054;&sigmaf; and
&pi;&tau;&#8051;&rho;&omicron;&nu;: <i>Ala</i> signifies that which
has a double Isle or Wing; the Ancients called so the Temples,
which were surrounded with two Ranges of Pillars, for there two
<i>Ranges</i> made two <i>Portico&rsquo;s</i>, which they called
<i>Wings</i>, we <i>Isles</i>, from the French word <i>Ailes</i>,
which signifies <i>Wings</i>, because as Wings are on the sides of
Birds, so these of Edifices.</p>

<h4>E</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_e.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="E" /><i>Chinus</i>, from &#7936;&pi;&#8056;

<i>Hedg-hog</i>; it is a Member of Architecture, which we call a
<i>Quarter-round</i>; it has its name from the roughness of its
Carving, resembling the prickly Rhind of the Chesnut, and not
unlike the Hedg-hog; it&rsquo;s commonly next to the <i>Abacus</i>,
and carved with Ovals and Darts, sometimes called Eggs and Anchors,
because these pretended Chesnuts are cut in an Oval form.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Entablature</i> signifies properly the
Flooring or Lofting with Boards; it comes from the Latin word
<i>Tabulatum</i>. In Architecture it&rsquo;s that part which is
composed of the <i>Architrave</i>, <i>Frise</i>, and
<i>Cornice</i>, for in effect this part is the extream part of the
Flooring, which is supported by Pillars, or by a Wall if it have no
Pillars.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Eye</i> is the middle of the <i>Jonick</i>
Volute, which is cut in the form of a little Rose.</p>

<i>bene</i>, and &alpha;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&#8056;&sigmaf;
<i>numera</i>: it signifies Proportion; it&rsquo;s taken in its
general signification in <i>Architecture</i>; for in its particular
signification it signifies the true measure that is observed in
Dancing after Musick.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Eustyle</i>, from &epsilon;&#8022;
<i>bene</i>, and &sigma;&tau;&#8058;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; a
<i>Pillar</i>; its the Order where Pillars are rightly placed, the
Intercolumniations being two Diameters and a quarter.</p>

<h4>F</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_f.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="F" /><i>Ace</i> is a Member of Architecture,
which has a great Breadth and a small Projecture; it&rsquo;s in
<i>Architraves</i>.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Filet</i> is a little square streight
Member.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Fresco</i>, and to paint in <i>Fresco</i> or
<i>Freth</i>, is an Italian Phrase, and it signifies the Painting

<p class="indent_3"><i>Frise</i> is that part which is between the
<i>Architrave</i> and the <i>Cornice</i>.</p>

<h4>G</h4>

<p class="indent_2"><img src="images/capital_g.png" class=
"floatLeft3" alt="G" /><i>Nomonick</i> is the Art of making
Sun-dials; it&rsquo;s derived from the Greek

parts, which to the number of six are put below every
<i>Triglyph</i> in the <i>Architrave</i> of the <i>Dorick
Order</i>.</p>

<h4>H</h4>

little Model, a little Measure: It&rsquo;s that part which is so
often repeated in the <i>Corinthian</i> and <i>Compound
Cornice</i>, which supports the Projecture of the <i>Larmier</i> or
<i>Drip</i>. This part is called the little <i>Model</i> in respect
of the great Model, which is the Diameter of the Pillar; for as the
Proportion of an Edifice depends on the <i>Diameter</i> of the
<i>Pillar</i>, so the greatness of the Modellians, their number,
and their space or distances, must have a just Proportion or true
Relation to the whole Fabrick.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Module</i> or <i>Model</i> is a measure that
is made use of to regulate all the Proportion of the
<i>Fabrick</i>: In the <i>Dorick Order</i> it&rsquo;s half the

&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; <i>circum</i>, and
&sigma;&tau;&#8058;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; <i>columna</i>;
signifies that which has Pillars round about: It differs from the
<i>Periptere</i> in this, that the Pillars of the <i>Peristyle</i>
are within, as it were round about a Court, and those of the

Ancients.</p>

<p class="indent_3"><i>Pedestal</i>, is that part which supports
the Pillar.</p>

<h2>To the Reader.</h2>

<p><i>Abridgments of</i> Vitruvius <i>have been formerly printed,
but none of them have followed the design which</i> Philebert de
l'Orme <i>has given in his Third Book: He desires that in
abridging</i> Vitruvius <i>the matters which this Author treats of
confusedly should be put into order, and that the things belonging
to the same Subject, which are found dispersed in divers places,
should be collected together into one Chapter. This Method, which
the most part of the eminent Writers have neglected, has been
carefully observed in this Treatise, it serving very much to the
better apprehending and retaining the things treated of. We have
been exact to put in nothing that is not taken out of</i>
Vitruvius, <i>to which end the</i> Book <i>and</i> Chapter <i>of
his Works</i> are <i>all along quoted in the Margin; nothing being
added, but some few lines here and there, to continue the
Discourse, and render it more clear: Notwithstanding which
precautions, some things may possibly still remain obscure, in
which case the Reader must have Recourse to the whole Works of</i>
Vitruvius, <i>where he will find all necessary Explanation.</i></p>

<p><i>This little Treatise is not only necessary for those who
begin the study of Architecture, but will be also of great use to
even Masters themselves; for it is not to be doubted, that</i>
Vitruvius <i>being so great a Master in this Art, his Authority,
together with that of all the Ancients, which is included in his
Works, must be capable of instructing the</i> Apprentices, <i>and
confirming the Masters, and thereby establish the good Maxims and
certain Rules of Architecture.</i></p>

<h3><i>Advertisement concerning this Translation.</i></h3>

<p>This Abridgment having been very well received in French, we
have ventured to put it in English, and doubt not but it will be as
acceptable to our Nation, who are allowed to be as competent Judges
of this Art as any. The Translation is very exact; the Cutts
altogether as well, if not better, than in the French; and in the
Table of the Explication of the Terms used in Architecture, we have
added the Etymology and Derivation of them, which is not in the
French.</p>
